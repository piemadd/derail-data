THE CREW HAD BEEN FLAGGING BLOCKS DUE TO POWER OUTAGES AND WERE TRAVELING AT 7 MPH.  THE TRAIN HAD 5 LOCOMOTIVES ON THE HEADEND AND 2 DISTRIBUTED POWER UNITS ON THE REAR OF THE TRAIN.  THE HEAD END LOCOMOTIVES LOST COMMUNICATION WITH THE DPU'S APPROACHING MILE POST 151.5, DURING WHICH TIME THE DPU'S DROPPED THEIR LOAD.  THIS SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER CAUSED A STRINGLINE DERAILMENT OF 10 CARS, WITH THE FIRST CAR DOWN BEING LINE 28 FROM THE HEAD END LOCOMOTIVES.
