RELIEF G02 DOUBLED THE CARS OVER AND STARTED AHEAD AFTER WALKING THE AIR TEST ON THE PORTION OF THE TRAIN THAT HAD JUST BEEN DOUBLED TOGETHER.  THE TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY.  THE CONDUCTOR WALKED BACK & FOUND THAT WHEN HE MADE THE JOINT ON THE DOUBLE, THE PIN DID NOT FALL INTO PLACE AND THE COUPLING CAME APART, WHICH CAUSED THE TRAIN TO GO INTO EMERGENCY.  THE COUPLING WAS MADE AGAIN, CHECKED AND THE CONDUCTOR WALKED BACK TO THE ENGINE AND TRAIN PROCEEDED TO DEPART. AFTER TRAVELINGAPPROXIMATELY .9 MILES THE TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY AGAIN.
