DUE TOTHE EXTENT OF DAMAGE/WRECKAGE, A DIRECT CAUSE OR LOCATION COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED. THE LOCOMOTIVESAND FIRST SIX CARS ON THE HEAD END OF THE CONSIST CROSSED THE BRIDGE, CARS SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE DROPPED INTO THE RIVER WITH THE BRIDGE TWISTED AROUND IT IN A MANGLED MASS (OBVIOUS THE INCIDENT HAPPENED ON THE WEST SIDE AND AT/NEAR CARS ELEVEN AND TWELVE)-THE COLLAPSE PULLED RAIL FROM BOTH APPROACHESAND SPREAD RAILCAR COMPONENTS THROUGHOUT THE RIVER BED. AFTER THE DERAILMENT, FOUR WELL EXPERIENCEDINDIVIDUALS EXAMINED THE AREA, NO CONSENSUS COULD BE REACHED ON EXACT CAUSE, OR LOCATION, IN PART DUE TO THE LACK OF EVIDENCE. THE CARS AND COMPONENTS WERE RETRIEVED AND REVIEWED AS PULLED FROM THE RIVER BED; THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF SEQUENCE,(LOCATION OF CARS AND COMPONETS, THE DIRECTION OF TWIST OFTHE STEEL BRIDGE STRUCTURE,ETC.), BUT NOTHING THAT COULD PROVIDE ANY FURTHER INSIGHT AS TO CAUSE ORINITIAL LOCATION. COULD NOT IDENTIFY POINT OF IMPACTS ON THE BRIDGE STRUCTURE OR SPECIFIC RAILCAR(S)SINCE THE RAILCARS WERE DENTED AND CRUSHED FROM THE INCIDENT, THE RAILCAR COMPONENTS WERE SCATTERED, AND THE STEEL BRIDGE STRUCTURE CUT AWAY FROM THE CARS IN ORDER TO REMOVE. THEREFORE, CAUSE WAS REPORTED AS UNDETERMINED.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"KJRY09162013201309","Report Key":"KJRY09162013201309","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"KJRY","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Keokuk Junction Railway","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Pioneer","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"KJRY","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Keokuk Junction Railway","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Pioneer"}
