TRAIN TOOK PTC PENALTY AT MP 324.7 DUE TO EXCESSIVE WHEEL SLIPPAGE ON ALL THREE LOCOMOTIVES THAT PUSHED SPEED UP ON PTC IETMS TO 25.3 MPH WHEN ACTUAL TRAINSPEED WAS 9 MPH IN T8. CREW RECEIVED TICKET TO CUTOUT PTC SO AS NOT TO GET ANOTHER ENFORCEMENT AS THEY ASCENDED 2% GRADE. TRAIN SPEED REACHED 9 MPH IN T3 AND T6 FOR NEXT 3- 4 MILES WITH EXCESSIVE WHEEL SLIP CONTINUING TO OCCUR.

THIRD UNIT UP8172 PERIODICALLY DROPPED IT'S LOAD AS TRAIN WAS IN T4-T6 AFTER THEPTC PENALTY. THIS, IN ADDITION, CAUSED TRACTION EFFORT DIFFICULTIES AND PREVENTED THE TRAIN FROM GAINING ANY MOMENTUM. ALL OF THESE FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDED GREASERS (FLANGE LUBRICATORS) ON THE CURVES, CONTRIBUTED TO THE STRINGLINE DERAILMENT.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"4","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP1122NC021202211","Report Key":"UP1122NC021202211","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
