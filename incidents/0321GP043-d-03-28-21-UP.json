THE ENGINEER STOPPED TO HAVE THE NEW SWITCH LINED AFTER LEAVING CPW511.  CREW MOVED APPROXIMATELY 2500 FEET INTO THE NORTH LEAD AND WENT INTO EMERGENCY.  AT THE TIME OF DERAILMENT, THE TRAIN SPEED RECORDED WAS 6 MPH AND IN DYNAMIC4-5.  MPCNP-25 DERAILED FOUR CARS IN CHEYENE YARD, MP 509.52 ON THE LARAMIE SUBDIVISION.  DERAILEDCARS WERE 52, 53, 54 AND 55 OF TRAIN CONSIST.  ENGINEER WAS MODULATING DYNAMIC BRAKES TO ENSURE SPEED COMPLIANCE.  FIRST CAR DERAILED WAS UNABLE TO NAVIGATE TURNOUT, BUT MECHANICAL MEASUREMENTS WERE WITHIN STANDARD.  FROG AT POINT OF DERAILMENT WAS WORN, BUT WITHIN ENGINEERING TOLERANCE.  TRAIN CONSIST HAD LOADS ON THE REAR, BUT MET WITH TRAIN MAKEUP REQUIREMENTS.  ENGINEER OPERATION OF TRAIN WASCOMPLIANT WITH RULE APPLICATION AND NO EXCEPTION TAKEN.  IT IS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO WHY THE FIRST CARFAILED TO NAVIGATE THE TURNOUT.  UPON IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL FACTORS, INVOLING MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT.  THE TRAIN WEIGHT WAS 16.794TONS WITH A LENGTH OF 11,685.  TOPOGRAPHICAL GRADIENT, THE DEVIATION FROM TANGENT TRACK, GRAVITATIONAL DISBURSEMENT AND FORCE EXHIBITED (LOADS TO EMPTIES), CUSHIONED DRAW BARS AND \"SLACK\" GENERATED FROM DESCENDING GRADE, THE RETARDING FORCE CREATED TO CONTROL SPEED; ALL COMBINED TO CREATE A LATERALFORCE AT THE WEAKEST POINT WITHIN THE CONSIST.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0321GP043202103","Report Key":"UP0321GP043202103","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
