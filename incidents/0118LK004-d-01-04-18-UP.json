AT BONITA, LA.  THE CONDUCTOR WALKED BACK AND FOUND THE DRAWBAR WAS OUT OF THE 84TH CAR FROM THE HEAD END ALONG WITH A SET OF TRUCKS DERAILED ON CAR TTPX805000 (EMPTY BULK HEAD FLAT).  THE TRAIN WAS TRAVELING 47 MPH IN THROTTLE 8 WITH NO AIR/INDEPENDENT/DYANAMIC BRAKING PRIOR TO THE UDE.  NO EXCEPTIONS WERE TAKEN WITH TRAIN HANDLING AS A CAUSE TO THIS DERAILMENT.  THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS DERAILMENT REVEALED THE DRAWBAR FELL OUT DUE TO A MISSINGRETAINING PIN.  THIS ALLOWED THE DRAWBAR TO STRIKE THE LEAD SET OF TRUCKS IN THE DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT, RESULTING IN THE DERAILMENT.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"4","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0118LK004201801","Report Key":"UP0118LK004201801","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
