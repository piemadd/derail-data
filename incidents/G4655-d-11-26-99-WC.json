AT THE SAME TIME, THE SWITCH CREW ON YARD JOB, FY1973, HAD GONE INTO TRACK 551 AND MADE A JOINT ON A CAR IN THE TRACK.  THE CONDUCTOR ON FY1973 DID NOT PROTECT HIS SHOVE MOVE ON TRACK 551 CAUSING THE REAR CAR TO BE SHOVED OUT IN FRONT OF FY1976.  FY1973 HAD STOPPED THEIR MOVE JUST BEFORE THE IMPACT OCCURRED BETWEEN THE ENGINE ON FY1976 AND THE REAR CAR ON FY1973.  FY1976 DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO STOP THEIR MOVE PRIOR TO IMPACT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CARWAS SHOVED OUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM.  NOTHING WAS DERAILED IN THE INCIDENT HOWEVER, THE ENGINE AND CAR INVOLVED BOTH SUSTAINED DAMAGE.  THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT REPORTED NO TRACK DAMAGE.
