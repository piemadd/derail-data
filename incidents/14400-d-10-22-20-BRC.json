THE CREW WAS IN THE PROCESS OF PULLING 43 CARS OUT OF 35 ECLS TO 32 EDEP WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. THE CONDUCTOR HAD NOTICED THE TRAIN SLOW TO A STOP UNDER CICERO AND THOUGHT THAT THE HELPER WAS GETTING A SWITCH. MEANWHILE, THE HELPER WAS ON THE LEADING END OF THE LOCOMOTIVE AND PULLED THE TRAIN TO THE CLEARANCE POINT ON THE EAST END OF 32 EDEP. WHEN THE HELPER WENT TO APPLY HANDBRAKES, HE REALIZED THAT HE ONLY HAD 11OF HIS 43 CARS. HE REPORTED TO THE YARDMASTER THAT THE TRAIN HAD CAME APART AND WENT TO SET THE BNSF 545203 OVER TO 33EDEP. ONCE HE PULLED THE CUT OUT HE HAD REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT JUST A BROKEN KNUCKLE, BUT THAT THE ENTIRE DRAWBAR WAS MISSING FROM THE BNSF 54203. AT THIS POINT THE 1500 EY ASSIGNMENT INFORMED THE 1430 EY ASSIGNMENT THAT THEY HAD DERAILED. INITIAL INVESTIGATION INDICATES THE DRAWBAR FROM THE BNSF 54203 HAD DAMAGE PRIOR TO THE DERAILMENT RESULTING IN THE DRAWBAR TO HANG LOW. THERE ARE DRAG MARKS THAT BEGIN ON THE LEAD UNDER CICERO NEAR THE 32/33 LEAD SWITCH. SHORTLY AFTER THELEAD SWITCH THERE IS VISIBLE DAMAGE WHERE THE DRAW BAR STRUCK A TIE WHICH CAUSED THE DRAWBAR TO DETACH, RESULTING IN THE DERAILMENT OF ALL 4 WHEELS ON THE A END OF SIRX 525372. THE DRAWBAR ALSO CAUSED DAMAGE TO SEVERAL TIES BETWEEN THE 32/33 LEAD SWITCH AND THE 32/33 SWITCH, AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO THE CHUTES/DOORS UNDER 4 HOPPER CARS.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"BRC14400202010","Report Key":"BRC14400202010","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"BRC","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Belt Railway Company Of Chicago","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"BRC","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Belt Railway Company Of Chicago","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
