THE ENGINEER THEN INFORMED THE CONDUCTOR THAT ID DIDN'T SEEM TO WANT TO DO ANYTHIND BETTER AND THEN WAS TOLD TO JUST KEEP COMING AS HE WAS SO THE CONDUCTOR COULD GET 3 MORE CAR LENGTHS.  THE ENGINEER THEN DOUBLE CHECKED ALL HIS GAUGES AND BUTTONS TO MAKE SURE NOTHING WAS WRONG AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP SAW THAT HIS TRAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 4 CAR LENGTHS ON THE WRONG TRACK.  AT THIS TIME THE CONDUCTOR WAS ALSOTELLING THE ENGINEER TO STOP, WHICH HE HAD ALREADY DONE.
