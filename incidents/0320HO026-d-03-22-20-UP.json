FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE DERAILMENT OF THE CARS OCCURRED DUE TO BYPASS DRAWBARS DURING FLAT SWITCHING OPERATIONS WITH THE YBS39 21.  AFTER FINAL INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT, A M599 CODE IS BEING USED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: A HUMAN FACTOR CAUSE WAS NOT APPLIED BECAUSE THE CAR(S) IN QUESTION WERE RELEASED IN THE DESIGNATED PINNING ZONE AND ON TANGENT TRACK.  THE CARS WERE RELEASED BETWEEN 3 & 5 MPH AND COUPLING SPEEDS WERE AT 4 MPH BASED ON THE SPEED OF THE RELEASE, DISTANCE TRAVELED, AND THE GRADE OF THE TRACK.  THE DRAWBAR WAS NOT SLEWED UPON RELEASE AND THE KNUCKLE WAS OPEN AS VERIFIED BY THE INVESTIGATION FIELD OFFICERS.  A REVIEW OF ANY POSSIBLE MECHANICAL DEFECTS WAS EVALUATED AND THE CAR MEASUREMENTS WERE WITHIN ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF COUPLER HEIGHTS WHICH IS BETWEEN 31 & 34 INCHES DEPENDING ONLOAD/EMPTY, AND THE AMOUNT OF GREASE AT THE COUPLER CARRIER WAS IN ACCEPTED STANDARDS.  A REVIEW OFANY POSSIBLE ENGINERRING DEFECTS WAS CONDUCTED AND THE TRACK WAS FOUND TO BE WITHIN ACCEPTED STANDARDS WITH TRACK MEASUREMENTS OF RAIL CONDITION AND GAUGE WITHIN ACCEPTED STANDARDS.  BASIN YARD DID HAVE FOUR TRACKS WITH S CURVES IN THE BODY OF THE TRACKS, 6 THRU 9.  IN AN EFFORT TO MITGATE THIS TYPEOF INCIDENT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE, THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT RE-ALIGNED TRACKS 6 THRU 9 TOSTRAIGHTEN OUT THE S CURVES IN THESE TRACKS, TO PREVENT FUTURE CROSS DRAWBAR DERAILMENTS DURING FLAT","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0320HO026202003","Report Key":"UP0320HO026202003","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
