EIGHT OF THE TEN DERAILED GRAIN CARS TIPPED OVER ONTO THEIR SIDES, SPILLING A PORTION OF THEIR CONTENTS AND FOULING THE BNSF MAIN LINE.  THE BNSF MAINLINE WAS OUT OF SERVICE FOR APPROXIMATELY 16 HOURS, UNTIL WORKERS COULD CLEAR THE WRECKAGE.  THE TWO LOCOMOTIVES EVENT RECORDER TAPES WERE EVALUATED BY MNN AND BNSF OFFICIALS AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TRAIN HANDLING WAS NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT.  CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE WIDE GAGE, DUE TO DEFECTIVE CROSSTIES. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE SOFT ROADBED, DUE TO WARMING TEMPERATURE FORCING THE FROST TO LEAVE THE GROUND.  MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION IN THE FORM OF RAIN ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE SOFT ROADBED CONDITIONS.NoneNoneNoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"3S","Class":"3S","Joint CD":"2","Incident Key":"BNSFMN0300105200003","Report Key":"MNNMNN032300200003","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"MNN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"MINNESOTA NORTHERN RAILROAD, INC.","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"KBN Inc","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-5 - BNSF","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"BNSF","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"BNSF Railway Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"BNSF Railway Company"}
