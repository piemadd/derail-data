THE CREW SHOVED THE ENTIRE TRAIN BACK WEST TO CLEAR THE EAST END OF THE YARD SO THEY COULD CUT THE DPU UNITS OFFAND RUN AROUND THE BALLOON TRACK TO ADD THE HEAD END OF THE TRAIN.  THE CREW SHOVED FOR 1.1 MILES.DURING THE SHOVE, THE DERAILMENT INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT A SWITCH WAS LINED AGAINST THE TRAIN, ANDTHE CONDUCTOR DID NOT LINE THE SWITCH.  THIS CREW CAME TO A STOP AND CUT THE DPU UNITS OFF, AND CUTTHEM INTO THE HEAD END OF THE TRAIN.  A RELIEF CREW GOT ON THE TRAIN AND STARTED PULLING EAST.  SINCE THE SWITCH HAD BEEN RUN THROUGH, THE CARS TRAVERSED TOWARD THE WAY THE SWITCH WAS LINED WHICH CAUSED THE CARS TO TRAVEL DOWN THE WRONG TRACK THAT THE REST OF THE TRAIN WAS ON.  THIS RESULTED IN 7 CARS DERAILING THAT WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRAIN.  THIS ALSO CAUSED SIGNIFICANT TRACK DAMAGE.","Joint Track Type":"Siding","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"MMAZINDUSTRY201807","Report Key":"UP0718SA005201807","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shippers","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"MMAZ","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Martin Marietta Aggregates, Inc.","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
