TRAINPROCEEDED DOWN HILL AT MP 124, SPEED REACHED ABOUT 10 MPH AS THE ENGINEER APPLIED THE BRAKES TO CONTROL THE SPEED THE ROLL STARTED. THE HARMONIC ROLL PULLED THE FRONT WHEEL OF THE FRONT TRUCK OF UP 73885 OFF THE RAIL. WHEN WHEEL CAME DOWN IT BEGAN TO HUNT RAIL WITH FLANGE RIDING ON TOP OF THE RAIL.THE WHEEL THEN CAME OFF ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE WEST RAIL CAUSING THE REAR WHEEL OF THE FRONT TRUCKTO COME OFF THE RAIL. THIS WHEEL BEGAN TO CUT THE TIES AND LAY THE WEST RAIL OVER GIVING THE FOLLOWING CARS NO PLACE TO RIDE. AS THIS HAPPENED THE TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY AND THE FORWARD MOTION ANDSLACK ACTION CAUSED THE REST OF THE DAMAGE. THIS CAUSED THE UP 73885 TO LAY OVER ON ITS SIDE AND ASTHE OTHER TRUCKS OF THE OTHER CARS BURIED UP IN THE ROADBED, THEY CAME OFF THE TRUCKS. THIS CAUSED TRACK DAMAGE AND JACKKNIFE EFFECT. THE TRAIN CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP AT MP 123.5 AND THIS IS WHERE THE TRACK DAMAGE IS. BOTH LOCOMOTIVES AND THE 1ST CAR OF THE TRAIN REMAINED ON THE RAIL.NoneNoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"0","Class Code":"3","Class":"3","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SSCSSC9503199506","Report Key":"SSCSSC9503199506","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"SSC","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Southern Switching Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"SSC","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Southern Switching Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
