AS THE CREW PULLED SOUTH ON TRACK 6S, THE FOREMAN (POSITIONED IN CABOF GRW LOCOMOTIVE 310) STATED HE FELT A LUNGE AND INSTRUCTED THE HELPER (CONTROLLING THE PULL FROMTHE CAB OF GRW LOCOMOTIVE 310) TO STOP THE MOVEMENT. UPON INSPECTION THE CREW REALIZED 6 OF THE 29 LOADS HAD DERAILED. \r\n\r\nA JOINT INVESTIGATION BETWEEN THE GRW TRANSPORTATION, MAINTENANCE, AND MECHANICAL DEPARTMENTS DETERMINED THE CREW FOREMAN HAD PLACED A SKATE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE RAIL AT THESOUTH END OF TRACK 6S PRIOR TO DOUBLING THE TWO TRACKS. THE HELPER, WHO MADE THE JOINT, FAILED TO REMOVE THE SKATE BEFORE BEGINNING THE PULL SOUTH, RESULTING IN THE SKATE SLIDING/DRAGGING UNTIL IT REACHED THE 4S/6S FROG. THE SKATE STOPPED SLIDING/DRAGGING WHEN IT REACHED THE FROG, CAUSING THE B-ENDSET OF TRUCKS ON THE BNSF 761447 TO JUMP THE SKATE AND DERAIL. THE NEXT 5 CARS IN THE CONSIST ALSO DERAILED PRIOR TO STOPPING THE MOVEMENT. FRESH MARKING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE RAIL AT THE SOUTH ENDOF TRACK 6S IS CONSISTENT WITH A SKATE SLIDING/DRAGGING ACROSS THE TOP OF THE RAIL.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"GRW01201501","Report Key":"GRW01201501","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"GRW","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Gary Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Transtar","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"GRW","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Gary Railway Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Transtar"}
