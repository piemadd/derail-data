THE COLUMBIA DEPOT SOUTHBOUND FOR PULASKI ON THE N&D.  ONE ENGINEER AND ONE BRAKEMAN WERE ON ENGINE 1959 WITH A CONSIST OF TWO CARS.  THE CARS WERE CSXT 486183 EMPTY GONDOLA (NEXT TO LOCOMOTIVE) AND PLCX \r\n224730 LOADED TANK WITH POLYPROPYLENE GLYCOL (STCC 28-185-55), A NON-HAZARDOUS, NON-DANGEROUS LIQUID PLASTIC.  THE TRAIN \r\nDEPARTED COLUMBIA DEPOT AT 12:05 PM.  AT MILEPOST 235.3, THE TWO CARS DERAILED AND TURNED OVER GOING DOWN THE EAST SIDE OF THE TRACK.THIS OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30 PM.  THERE WAS NO BREACH TO THE TANK CAR.  THE GONDOLA AND TANKSTAYED COUPLED TOGETHER DUE TO THE DOUBLE SHELF COUPLER OF THE TANK.  THE ENGINEER CALLED AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE MT.

THROUGH THEIR DISCUSSION AND OBSERVATIONS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TANK CAR KICKED A JOINT BAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE, THE TRACK SPREAD CAUSING THE LEAD SET OF TRUCKS ON THE TANK CARTO DERAIL TO THE EAST SIDE.  IT PULLED THE GONDOLA WITH IT TO A SOFT SHOULDER OF THE BANK AND ROLLEDDOWN THE BANK. BOTH CARS STILL COUPLED, CAME TO REST AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BANK, APPROXIMATELY 10-12FEET BELOW THE TOP OF THE RAIL.
