ENGINEER HAD GOTTEN THE ENGINE BRAKES TO RELEASE AND FORWARD MOVEMENT HAD JUST BEGUN.

HE HAD SET THE INDEPENDENT BRAKE AT FULL APPLICATION, AND WHEN IT WAS APPARENT THAT COLLISION WAS IMMINENT, HE REVERSED THE ENGINE CONSIST AND ADVACED THE THROTTLE TO NUMBER FOUR POSITION.  THE SPEED AT IMPACT WAS ESTIMATED AT FIVE TOEIGHT MILES PER HOUR.  THE TRAIN AIR BRAKE WAS NOT SET PRIOR TO IMPACT.
