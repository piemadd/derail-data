THE BRAKEE GOT OFF THE TRAIN AT THE AIR HOUSE, TO LINE THE SWITCH FROM MAIN TO THE HOSTLING TRACK.  THE BRAKEE INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER TO COME AHEAD AND TIE UP .  THE CONDUCTOR PICKED UP THE BRAKEE AT THE AIR HOUSE AND CHECKED THE SWITCH TOWARD THE NORPAC/ONP TRACK. THE BRAKEE AND CONDUCTOR FAILED TO CHECK THE SWITCH BETWEEN THE HOSTLING TRACK AND THE STORAGE TRACK.  THIS WASN'T CHECKED BECAUSE \"IT IS ALWAYS LINED TO THE HOSTLING TRACK.\"  AFTER THE SWITCH AT FUEL TRACK HAD BEEN CHECKED, THE CONDUCTOR AND BRAKEE (IN THE TRUCK) WERE HEADING BEHIND THE FUELING TANK WHEN THEY HEARD A LOUD NOISE.  THEY TURNED AND SAW THE LOCOMOTIVE 305 HITTING FIRST A LARGE RAIL SERVICE CART AND THEN THE SPEEDER #710 FOLLOWEDBY A SMALL CART.  THE IMPACT SHOVED THE CARTS AND SPEEDER INTO TWO LOCOMOTIVES THAT WERE ALSO PARKED  ON THIS STORAGE TRACK.  THE CONDUCTOR RADIOED THE ENGINEER TO STOP THE TRAIN.  THE ENGINEER STOPPED THE TRAIN AS SOON HE COULD.  AFTER STOPPING THE TRAIN HE BACKED IT UP 1/2 CAR LENGTH AND SET THEINDEPENDENT BRAKE.  HE LEFT THE ENGINE AND WALKED UP TO THE 305.  HE WAS LOCATED IN THE 307 LOCOMOTIVE WHICH WAS FARTHEST FROM THE INCIDENT AND ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LOCOMOTIVE.  HE WAS BLIND TO THE SWITCH AND BLIND TO THE STORAGE TRACK.  THE LOCOMOTIVE'S LOCATION ON THE TRACK AT THE TIME OF THEINCIDENT OBSCURED THE ENGINEER'S VIEW.
