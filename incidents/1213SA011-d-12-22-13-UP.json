THE CONDUCTOR SHOVED INTO THE WRONG TRACK INSIDE THEFACILITY, AND AFTER TALKING WITH A FOREMAN FROM CMC STEEL, TOLD THE ENGINEER TO TAKE THE TRAIN AHEAD TO GET TO THE CORRECT TRACK.  THE ISSUE WAS THAT WHEN THE UPRR CONDUCTOR SHOVED INTO THE WRONG TRACK, HE HAD RUN THROUGH A SWITCH.  WHEN THE JOB STARTED PULLING FORWARD, DUE TO THE RUN THROUGH SWITCH, THE CARS STARTED GOING DOWN A DIFFERENT TRACK THAN WHAT THE HEAD PORTION AND THE LOCOMOTIVES WEREGOING DOWN.  THIS CAUSED 3 CARS TO DERAIL.
