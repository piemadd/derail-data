AFTER MAKING SEVERAL SWITCH MOVES, THEIR CUT OF CARS BROKE APART NEAR THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN. THE CREW WAS UNAWARE OF THIS BREAK AS IT HAD OCCURRED UP THE SWITCHING LEAD AND THE CREW WAS DOWN IN THE FIELD. WHEN THEY CHANGED DIRECTIONS TO INITIATE A SHOVE MOVE TO RESUME SWITCHING, THE DJTX516529 DERAILED WHEN IT CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE HPJX900443. THE SHOVE MOVE CONTINUED ULTIMATELY DERAILING 4 CARS. WE BELIEVE DERAILMENT WAS CAUSED BY MIS-MATCHED COUPLERS BETWEEN THE DJTX516529 AND THE HPJX900443.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"3","Incident Key":"UP0822RM012202208","Report Key":"UP0822RM012202208","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
