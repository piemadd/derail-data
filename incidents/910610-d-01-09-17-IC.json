DAMAGE WAS SUSTAINED TO BOTH LOCOMOTIVES, BCOL 4601 AND GTW 5829. A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT AND COULD NOT BE PINPOINTED TO ANY ON THING. EVERYTHING WAS WITHIN ACCEPTABLE TOLERANCES BUT EACH FRACTION OF CHANGE COMBINED AT THIS LOCATION CAUSED THE FUEL TANK TO BOTTOM OUT ON THE CROSSING. IT WASA COMBINATION OF THE REAR OF THE LOCOMOTIVE RIDING LOWER WITH THE TRACK PANELS SITTING PROUD ABOVETHE TOP OF THE RAIL, RAIL ACTION AND MILD PUMPING AND TYPICAL SUSPENSION RESPONSE. ALL OF THESE DIFFERENCES, COMBINED COULD ADD UP TO MORE THAN 5-1/2\" OF ELEVATION DIFFERENCE THAT WOULD CAUSE SUCH ANIMPACT.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"4","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"IC910610201701","Report Key":"IC910610201701","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America"}
