AFTER THE LOCOMOTIVE TRAVELED THROUGH THE CROSSING AT MP\r\n42.57, THE CREW NOTICED THAT DIRT AND DEBRIS WERE BEINGTHROWN AROUND AT THE REAR OF THE LOCOMOTIVE. THE ENGINEER STOPPED THE TRAIN AND\r\nDISCOVERED THAT THE#3 AXLE ON WAMX 4040 WAS DERAILED.\r\nUPON INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THE DERAILMENT WAS CAUSEDBY THE LEFT #3 WHEEL ON WAMX 4040 RIDING UP ON THE OUTSIDE MUD RAIL ON THE WEST\r\nSIDE AT THE APPROACH OF THE CROSSING. THE MUD RAIL WAS FOUND TO BE ELEVATED 2.5 INCHES ABOVE THE MAIN LINE RAIL AND BENT DOWN AT THE END ACTING AS A\r\nRAMP. THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT INDICATED WHEELS FROM ROLLING STOCK HADPREVIOUSLY BEEN COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE TOP EDGE OF THE BENT DOWN\r\nPORTION OF THE MUD RAIL AT THE APPROACH OF THE CROSSING. THE FLANGE THICKNESS ON LEFT #3 WHEEL ON WAMX 4040 MEASURED AT 1- 3/64\".IT WAS DETERMINED\r\nTHAT THE COMBINATION OF THE ADDED FOOTPRINT OF THE WHEEL AND THE LOCATION AND POSITION OF THE ELEVATED MUD RAIL WAS JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE\r\nLOCOMOTIVE WHEEL TO RAMP UP THE MUD RAIL, TRANSVERSE UP AND OVER THE MAIN TRACK RAIL AND RIDE ALONG IT RESULTING IN THE WHEEL DROPPING OFFTO\r\nTHE GROUND AT THE OTHER END OF THE CROSSING.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"EIRR200717004202007","Report Key":"EIRR200717004202007","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"EIRR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Eastern Idaho Railroad, LLC","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Watco","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"EIRR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Eastern Idaho Railroad, LLC","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Watco"}
