WE COULD NOT ASCERTAIN THE EXACT CAUSE OF THIS DERAILMENT, BUT KNOW SOMETHING WITH THE CAR HAD CAUSED IT TO CLIMB AT THE #2 SWITCH AT DONALDSONVILLE.  THE CENTER BOWL FRICTION PLATE ON THELEAD SET OF TRUCKS WAS NOT MAKING FULL CONTACT WITH THE TRUCKS, HOWEVER, WAS WITHIN THE LIMITS AND THE CAR WAS EQUIPPED WITH CONTACT SIDE BEARINGS WHICH WERE MAKING NORMAL CONTACT.  THIS CAR HAD TWO NEW SETS OF WHEELS, 1 REWORKED SET AND 1 SET WITH NORMAL WEAR.  WE DON'T THINK IT WAS STIFF TRUCKS, HOWEVER, FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE CAR WAS NOT NEGOTIATING PROPERLY AND RIDING \"LIGHT\" ON THE FRONT SETOF TRUCKS.
