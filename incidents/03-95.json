GUNNELL (#5405) WAS INVOLVED IN A SWITCHING COLLISION AT HCMF. MR. GUNNELL WAS TO OPERATE A THREE CAR TRAIN (882-108-847) FROM SIGNAL #106X TO TRK #14 BETWEEN SIGNAL RK-140X AND R200X FOR STORAGE. THERE WAS A LIGHT RAIN WHICH CAUSED THE RAILS TO BEWET. MR. GUNNELL (OPERATING FROM CAR #882) STATED IN HIS REPORT THAT AFTER ENTERING TRK #14 HE BEGAN APPLYING HIS BRAKES. HE THEN REALIZED THE TRAIN WAS NOT BRAKING PROPERLY. THE TRAIN WENT THROUGH THE TRIPPER AND STRUCK THE BAY DOOR TO THE MAINTENANCE BUILDING CAUSING DAMAGE OF APPROX $14,700. ANINVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT SHOWED TWO CARS HAD THE BRAKES CUT-OUT (108-847). THE DISTANCE BETWEENSIGNAL RK-140X AND R200X WAS MEASURED TO BE 240 FT. THE DISTANCE FROM SIGNAL R200X TO THE BAY DOOROF THE MAINTENANCE BUILDING IS 36 FT; FOR A TOTAL DISTANCE OF 276 FT. A TEST WAS CONDUCTED ON 3/29/95 ON TRK #28 WITH THREE CARS (657-172-649). THE TEST RESULTS INDICATE THAT WET RAIL AND TWO CAR BRAKES CUT OUT WILL INCREASE THE BRAKING DISTANCE BEFORE A THREE CAR TRAIN WILL COME TO A STOP (E04C). THIS IS A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE.
