At approx.3:00 p.m. that same day, P&L crew picked up the train which became train WW227. with three UP locomotives and 101 loaded coal cars, and derailed 9 loads of coal while leaving  track Zip 1 at Paducah.As a result of the derailment, 1578 feet of track was destroyed as well as extensive damage to Island Creek Bridge.  \r\n\r\nInvestigation revealed that the first point of derailment occurred 1578 feet in advance of the Island Creek Bridge.  Analysis of the event recorder data revealed that two emergency brake applications occurred.  The first occurred 1350 feet in advance of the bridge.  This indicates that the car derailed 228 feet prior to the first emergency application.  The second emergency application occurred at the bridge.  The UP crew was in possession of the train when the first emergency application occurred and when brakes released, pulled the train forward approximately 190 feet to the point of final stop.\r\n\r\nData from the derailment site, as well as event recorder and other information, was analyzed. Although a definitive cause for this derailment has not been established, based on analysis by P&L personnel as well as Rail Sciences, Inc. of Scottsdale, GA, there is no doubtthat the initial derailment occurred while the train was in the possession of the UP crew and thatwhen the P&L crew took possession and began leaving, the major damage occurred.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"2","Incident Key":"PAL2007DEC1D200712","Report Key":"PAL2007DEC1D200712","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 2","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"PAL","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Paducah & Louisville Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"P&L","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"Class 1","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 2","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"PAL","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Paducah & Louisville Railway Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"P&L"}
