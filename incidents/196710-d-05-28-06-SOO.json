GH-31 WAS STOPPED & HUMP YARDMASTER ADVISED THAT IT LOOKED LIKE THE CP 522245 HAD LOST IT'S EAST TRUCK ON THE LEAD.  INSPECTION FOUND A TRUCK SITTING BY ITSELF ON THE LEAD & ONE SET OF WHEELS APPROX 40' EAST OF THE TRUCK. THE OTHER SET OF WHEELS REMAINED UNDER THE CP 522245 & KEPT IT SUPPORTED UNTIL IT REACHED THE TOP OF THE HUMP (APPROX 250' FROM WHERE TRUCKS WERE FOUND). MKT 10043  WAS ALSO FOUND WITH EAST TRUCK  DERAILED AS A RESULT OF DEBRIS FROM THE CP 522245.  GH-31 HAD AHOLD OF TRACK CT16 (1 LOCOMOTIVE PLUS 43 CARS).THE CP 522245 WAS THE 40TH CAR (TRAIN POSITION 41) & MKT 100413 WAS THE 42ND CAR (TRAIN POSITION 43).  A NUMBER OF HUMP RETARDERS WERE DAMAGED. INVESTIGATION FOUND THE CP 522245 HAD A WORN FRICTION PLATE ON EAST TRUCK WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MISSING FOR SOME TIME, APPARENTLY AS A RESULT OF A STIFF TRUCK. A MECHANICAL INSPECTION DETERMINED THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS KNOWN THAT CP 522245 WAS DEFECTIVE, THAT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FACTOR IN THE DRAILMENT, THIS LEFT THE ONLY FACTOR TO BE SPEED ATTHE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  DURING THIS TYPE OF MOVEMENT, THE ACCURACY OF ANALOG SPEED RECORDERS ONA LOCOMOTIVE DOES NOT PERMIT AN ACCURATE READING AS A RESULT OF THE SLOW SPEED REQUIRED (UNDER 10 MPH).  THE SPEED INDICATED CAN VARY BY SEVERAL MILES AN HOUR DURING SUCH A RESTRICTED MOVEMENT.
