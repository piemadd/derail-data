WHEN THE HEAD END OF THE TRAIN HAD REACHED THE BASE OF THEGRADE WHERE IT WAS LEVEL FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE, BEFORE ASCENDING A SIMILAR GRADE, THE ENGINEER WENT FROM SET UP TO IDLE.  IN PTB WE WERE ABLE TO SEE AFTER THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEALOF BUFF FORCE IN APPROXIMATELY THE 40 CARS RIGHT BEHIND THE CAR THAT WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE DERAILED FIRST.  THE ENGINEER DIDN'T VIOLATE ANY TRAIN HANDLING RULES BUT COULD HAVE HAD THE MID TRAIN DISTRIBUTIVE POWER FENCE-UP AND APPLIED ADDITIONAL POWER FROM THAT LOCOMOTIVE TO CONTROL RUN IN AND RUNOUT.  THIS IS POTENTIALLY AN ISSUE WITH THE COMBINATION OF TRAIN MAKEUP WITH MULTIPLE CUSHIONED DRAWBAR CARS INTERACTING WITH THE FORCE THAT IS BEING CAUSED.  MEANING, THE REASON THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A TRAIN HANDLING RULE VIOLATION, THE COMBINATION OF THE DRAWBARS AND THE TRAIN HANDLING RESULTEDIN A CAR WITH A CUSHIONED DRAWBAR TO BE FORCED OUT OF THE TRAIN AT THE BOTTOM OF A GRADE (AND IN A SLIGHT CURVE).  WITHOUT THE TRAIN BEING BUILT WITH MULTIPLE CUSHIONED DRAWBARS, AS A MID DPU TRAIN, THIS TRAIN HANDLING WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A CONCERN FOR DERAILMENT.
