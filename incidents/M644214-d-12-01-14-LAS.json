THERE WERE FOUR UNITS IN THE CONSIST.  WAMX 4007, WAMX3911, WAMX 4025, AND WAMX 4004.  THE CREW DEPARTED HODGE WITH 38 CARS AND 4940 TONS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 1330 THE ENGINEER NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM THE WAMX 4004.  WHEN HE STOPPED THE TRAIN HE FOUND THE LEADS ON THE #3 TRACTION MOTOOR WHERE ON FIRED.  THE FIRE WASEXTINGUISHED AND CHARLES HOULTON, CMO, WA NOTIFIED.  THE INFORMATION GIVEN FROM THE ENGINEER IT WAS FELT THE FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED AND WOULD BE SAFE TO MOVE.  THE TRACTION MOTOR WAS CUT OUT AND THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS PULLED 3 MILES TO MILE POST 27 WHERE THE CREW WAS OUT OF TIME.  THR TRACTION MOTOTR WAS LOOKED AT AGAIN AND THERE DID NOT APPERA TO BE ANY SMOKE OR FIRE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO EXTINQUISH THE FIRE.  THE WAMX4004 WAS A TOTAL LOSS. \r\n\r\nA REVIEW OF THE DOWNLOADS FOUND THAT WAMX 4025 AND WAMX 3911 BOTH SHOWEDOVERLOADING OF THE TRACTION MOTORS DURING THE TRIP, ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE FAILURE OF THE TRACTION MOTOR ON 4004 AND THE FIRE TO OCCUR.  WHEN LOOKING AT THE LEAD LOCOMOTIVE, WAMX 4007 THE AMPERAGE SHOWSTO BE LOWER THAN NORMAL OPERATING RANGES.  THE ENGINEER WAS OPERATIN WITHIN WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS NORMAL LIMITS.  IT WAS FOUND THAT THE WAMX 4007 WAS NOT SHOWING THE PROPER AMPERAGE READINGS.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"LASM644214201412","Report Key":"LASM644214201412","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"LAS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Louisiana Southern","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Watco","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"LAS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Louisiana Southern","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Watco"}
