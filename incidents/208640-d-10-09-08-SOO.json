CONDUCTOR STOPPED AND LINED TRAIN FOR ROUTE FROM RUNNING TRACK. WHILE PULLING INTO TRACK WEST #3 FELT TRAIN PULLING HARD & STOPPED. CONDUCTOR WALKED BACK & FOUND CARS 27 -35 DERAILED. CSX ADVISES APPROXIMATELY $5,000 TRACK REPAIRS.  INVESTIGATION RESULTS FROM CSX INDICATES CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT WAS A COMBINATION OF TRACK LAYOUT, TERRAIN, AND BUFF FORCES.  A COMBINATION OF ELEVATION CHANGES COMBINED WITH THE NUMBER OF CROSSOVERS AND TURNOUTS THE TRAIN WAS TRAVERSING, IN ADDITION TO THE BUFF FORCES OF TRAILING TONS CAUSED THE DERAILMENT. THE T.A.P.S. COMMITTEE IS IN AGREEMENT THAT THE CAUSE CODE IS H599.  THE HEAD END OF THE TRAIN WAS ON AN ASCENDING GRADE WITH THE HEAD 26 CARS, AS THE TRAIN PROCEEDED INTO W03.  AS THE ENGINEER SLOWED THE TRAIN THE 27TH CAR WASTRAVELING THRU THE TURNOUT INTO W03, THE TRAILING 46 CARS ARE NOW ON THE DESCENDING GRADE TRAVELINGAT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED.  WHEN THE TRAILING 46 CARS MET WITH THE 27TH CAR THE BUFF FORCES CAUSEDTHE R1 WHEEL ON THE TTGX 991146 TO LIFT OFF THE RAIL IN THE TURNOUT.  THIS IMPACT ROLLED THE NORTH RAIL AT POD AND CAUSED THE 28TH THRU 35TH CAR TO FALL IN BETWEEN THE RAIL UNTIL THE ENGINEER NOTICEDTHE TRAIN WAS NOT TRAVELING NORMALLY. CSX FUTHER ADVISED CP CREW NOT RESPONSIBLE & CSX WILL ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITY ALONG WITH COMPLETING FORM 81.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"1L","Class":"1L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"CSX000052657200810","Report Key":"SOO208640200810","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian Pacific Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation"}
