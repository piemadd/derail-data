CUT OFF FROM TRAIN EAST OF INDUSTRY, AND PULLED CARS UP THE MIN LINE AND RAN AROUND CARS.  NOTE THIS INDUSTRY OPENS TO THE EAST ONLY.  ENGINEER STAYED ON WEST LEAD MOTOR AND DID NOT SWAP ENDS; CONDUCTOR PROTECTED SHOVES.  SPOTTED THE 7 LOADS OF CORN TO THE701 CORN UPPER TRACK, AND WAS REVERSING MOVEMENT OUT TOWARD MAIN LINE.  AS THE WAMX 4118 LEAD TRUCKCAME INTO THE TURNOUT SECTION, THE R1 WHEEL DERAILED AT THE JOINT WHERE THE LH STOCK CONNECTS WITH THE CLOSURE RAIL.  IT THEN PROCEEDED TO ROLL THE OUTSIDE (SOUTH) RAIL ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE ABS MAINLINE SWITCH.  THE WAMX 3813 MIDDLE UNIT, FOLLOWED AND DERAILED AS WELL.  AS THE WAMX 4118 PASSED OVER THE GUARDRAIL TO THE ABS MAIN TRACK SWITCH, THE GUARD RAIL ROLLED UP, BROKE, AND SLICED OPEN THEFUEL TANK WITH A 10 FT X 10 IN WIDE GASH, IMMEDIATELY SPILLING ALL 2500 GALLONS OF FUEL DOWN THE EMBANKMENT INTO A BEAVER POND WETLAND.
