THE TRAIN PROCEEDED OFF THE BRIDGE FAILING TO STOP AT THE NORTH CROSSOVER SWITCH (SWITCH 23) AS INSTRUCTED. ONCE THE UP CREW REALIZED THEY WERE ON THE WRONG TRACK, THEY STOPPED THEIR TRAIN IMMEDIATELY AND NOTIFIED THE OPERATOR. THEY REPORTED TO THE OPERATOR THAT THE NORTH SWITCH WAS LINED FOR THE WEST MAIN STILL AND THAT THE SOUTH SWITCH WAS LINED FOR MOVEMENT THROUGH THE CROSSOVERS TO THE EAST MAIN. THE CREW OF YAV97-11 STOPPED 4 CARS LENGTHS EAST OF THE FACING POINT #23 CROSSOVER SWITCH. HAD THE CREW HANDLED THEIR TRAIN WITHIN COMPLIANCE WITH RESTRICTED SPEED AND STOPPED SHORT OF THE #23 NORTH (WEST) END OF THE CROSSOVER IN THE WRONG POSITION, THE DERAILMENT WOULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED. THE UP ADVISED$532 IN EQUIPMENT DAMAGE AND THE NOPB ADVISED $13,500 IN TRACK DAMAGE.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"NOPBD20160613F201606","Report Key":"IC891488201606","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"Class 1","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"NOPB","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"New Orleans Public Belt Railroad","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
