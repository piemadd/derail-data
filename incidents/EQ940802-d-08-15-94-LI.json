THE DERAILMENT WAS THE RESULT OF SEVERAL UNIQUE FACTORS, WHICH COMBINED TO AFFECT THE DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WHEEL AND THE SWITCH POINT: \"91 SWITCH\" IS A LEFT-HAND T.O., CONSTRUCTED IN A LEFT-HAND CURVE COMPOUNDING THE DEGREEOF CURVATURE AT THE SWITCH POINT TO 21 DEGREES. THE CROSS LEVEL AT THE POINT OF SWITCH WAS 7/8\" WITHTHE RH POINT ABOVE THE PLANE OF THE LH POINT. WITHIN 48 HOURS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, ONE INCH OF RAIN FELL ON THE SITE; PUMPING OF TIMERS WAS VISIBLE, CAUSING THE 7/8\" CROSS LEVEL TO INCREASE BY AS MUCH AS 3/4\". IMMEDIATELY WEST OF 91 SWITCH, 85 SLIP WAS \"CRIBBED\" (BALLAST REMOVED) IN PREPARATION FOR RENEWAL, WHICH CAUSED SURFACE DEFLECTIONS PRIOR TO ENTRANCE TO 91 SWITCH. THE HEEL OF THE RIGHT-HAND POINT WAS LOW IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE POINT (PROFILE), CAUSING THE POINT TO SLIGHTYLY PROTRUDE FROM ITS HOUSING.NoneNoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"LIEQ940802199408","Report Key":"LIEQ940802199408","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"LI","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Long Island Rail Road","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"LI","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Long Island Rail Road","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
