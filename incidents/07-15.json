THE OPERATOR THEN POSITIONED HIMSELF ON THE LEAD LADLE (160) WHILE SHOVING EAST ONTHE QBOP LEAD TRACK.

THERE WERE FLANGE MARKS ON BOTH THE NORTH AND SOUTH RAIL.  THERE WERE NO EXCEPTIONS TAKEN WITH TRAIN HANDLING OR TRACK GAUGE AND/OR ANY CROSS LEVEL DEFECTS.  THE CAUSE OF THISINCIDENT WAS DUE TO SIDE BEARING CLEARANCE ON LADLE 148.  THE SIDE BEARING CLEARANCE WAS INADEQUATECAUSING THE TRUCKS TO BE IMPEDED BY THE LADLE BODY.
