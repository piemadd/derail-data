THE R2 WHEEL OF LOCOMOTIVE 1315 (1315 SHUTDOWN, UNOCCUPIED, AND BEING TOWED BACKWARD AT THE REAR OF THE TRAIN) DROPPED INTO THE GAGE AS THE UNIT ENTERED THE BODY OF A 10 DEGREE CURVE.  THETRAIN WAS TRAVELING 17 MPH, #3 THROTTLE, LOADING 400 AMPS AT THE TIME OF THE DERAILMENT.  THOUGH DERAILED, 1315 REMAINED UPRIGHT FOR ROUGHLY 400 FEET UNTIL THE DERAILED R2 WHEEL CONTACTED THE FROG OFTHE NE 327 SIDING SWITCH.  AT THAT TIME THE FROG AND CURVED CLOSURE RAIL OF THE SWITCH SERVED TO GUIDE THE REST OF THE #1 TRUCK AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE LOCOMOTIVE OFF THE TRACK, LAYING IT OVER ON ITS SIDE.  THE DERAILING OF LOCOMOTIVE 1315 ALSO LIFTED THE ADJACENT CAR (UNOCCUPIED CABOOSE, SOUTHERN X261) OFF ITS TRUCKS AND IT CAME TO REST, STILL COUPLED AT BOTH ENDS, AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE.  THE ENGINEER NOTICED THE DERAILED WHEEL AND APPLIED THE BRAKES IN \"EMERGENCY\" AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME THE DERAILED WHEEL STRUCK THE SWITCH.  NO EMPLOYEES OR PASSENGERS WERE INJURED, AND THE TRAIN WAS NOT CARRYING ANY HAZ-MAT.  THERE WAS A SMALL FUEL SPILL FROM LOCOMOTIVE 1315 WHICH WAS CONTAINED ON THE RR ROW, AND CLEANED UP BY A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRACTOR.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"HR20101201006","Report Key":"HR20101201006","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"HR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Heritage Railroad Corp","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"Tourist, Excursion, Historical","Other Railroad Class":"Class 3","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"SPRX","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN RAILWAY MUSEUM","Other Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"HR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Heritage Railroad Corp","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"},"0624108594-d-06-24-10-SEPA":{"Reporting Railroad Code":"SEPA","Reporting Railroad Name":"Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority","Report Year":"2010","Accident Number":"0624108594","PDF Link":"https://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/Officeofsafety/Publicsite/FORM54/F54Report.aspx?RepType=SQL&txtf54key=SEPA062410859420100624","Accident Year":"10","Accident Month":"06","Other Railroad Code":"","Other Railroad Name":"","Other Accident Number":"","Other Accident Year":"","Other Accident Month":"","Maintenance Railroad Code":"SEPA","Maintenance Railroad Name":"Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority","Maintenance Accident Number":"0624108594","Maintenance Accident Year":"10","Maintenance Accident Month":"06","Grade Crossing ID":"","Day":"24","Date":"06/24/2010","Time":"3:25 PM","Accident Type Code":"09","Accident Type":"Obstruction","Hazmat Cars":"0","Hazmat Cars Damaged":"0","Hazmat Released Cars":"0","Persons Evacuated":"0","Subdivision":"","Division Code":"SYSTEM","Division":"SYSTEM","Station":"PHILADELPHIA","Milepost":"4.4","State Code":"42","State Abbreviation":"PA","State Name":"PENNSYLVANIA","County Code":"101","County Name":"PHILADELPHIA","District":"2","Temperature":"95","Visibility Code":"2","Visibility":"Day","Weather Condition Code":"3","Weather Condition":"Rain","Track Type Code":"1","Track Type":"Main","Track Name":"#1","Track Class":"2","Track Density":"","Train Direction Code":"2","Train Direction":"South","Equipment Type Code":"2","Equipment Type":"Passenger Train -
