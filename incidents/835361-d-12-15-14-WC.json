NO CARS DERAILED IN THE IMPACT. INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT FOUND THAT THE 2 CARS INVOLVED ENTERED THE INERT RETARDER NEARLYCOUPLED, ENABLING THE 2 EXTRA HEAVY CARS TO PUSH THROUGH THE INERT RETARDER. PREDICTED SPEED OF DOWX82092 WAS 6.4 MPH AND GATX 211854 WAS PREDICTED TO COUPLE AT 6.1 MPH. WITH THE PROXIMITY OF THE 2 CARS ENTERING THE RETARDER NEARLY COUPLED, THE COMBINED WEIGHT BECOMES 521,000 POUNDS AT 6 MPH. THE MOST WEIGHT THAT THIS STYLE OF INERT CAN SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE IS 315,000 POUNDS AT 7.9 MPH. HAD ONE CAR ENTERED THE INERT RETARDER ON THE WEST END AT A TIME, THIS INCIDENT WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE OCCURRED.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"No","Class":"No","Joint CD":"3","Incident Key":"WC835361201412","Report Key":"WC835361201412","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America"}
