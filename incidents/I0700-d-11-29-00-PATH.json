CAR #737 DERAILED TRAVELING WEST WHILE TRAVERSING THE KINNEY CROSSOVER FROM TRACK H TO TRACK G IN SOUTH STREET YARD.  THE LEAD TRUCK DERAILED ON THE HOUSETOP OF 9W SWITCH.  THE HOUSETOP LOOSENED AND WAS PULLED FREE.  THE HOUSETOP WAS FOUND 10 FEET WEST OF THE SWITCH.  THE POINT OF DERAILMENT WAS ON THE CURVED STOCK RAIL OF 9W SWITCHAT THE #3 ROD.  THE WHEELS DERAILED TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE RAIL ON THE INSIDE OF THE TURNOUT.  THEFIRST AXLE WENT ON THE GROUND APPROXIMATELY 11' 2\"FROM THE POINT OF DERAILMENT.  THE SECOND AXLE WENT ON THE GROUND 28' 6\" FROM THE POINT OF DERAILMENT.  THE WHEELS RODE OVER A SIGNAL TRIPPER ASSEMBLY, AND THE CAR IMPACTED A SIGNAL POLE AND THE CONCRETE GIRDER OF THE KINNEY STREET BRIDGE.  THE CARCAME TO A STOP 250 FEET BEYOND THE POINT OF DERAILMENT. THE TOTAL DAMAGE TO SIGNAL TRACK AND EQUIPMENT WAS ESTIMATED AT $192,834.  FULL ACCOUNTING FOR THE INCIDENT REMAINS PENDING THE ENGINEERING REPORT.  PRELIMINARY DOLLARS REFLECT REPLACEMENT COST.  THE TYPE AND DEGREE OF DAMAGE CORRELATES WITH EXCESSIVE LATERAL FORCES ON THE SWITCH.  THIS MAY BE CAUSED BY SPEED GREATER THAN ALLOWABLE THROUGH THE SWITCH.  SOUTH STREET YARD IS NOT EQUIPPED WITH TIMED SIGNALS WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR SPEED CALCULATION.  THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT WAS EXCESSIVE SPEED, HOWEVER THE EVIDENCE IS INCONCLUSIVE. THERE WAS ALSO NO PROOF THAT THE DISLODGED HOUSETOP WAS CAUSED BY THE TRAIN ENGINEER.
