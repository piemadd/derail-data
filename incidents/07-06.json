AS THE TRAIN DEPARTED, THE POWER SWITCH MACHINE BECAME UNLOCKED AND THE SWITCH POINTS OPENED UNDER THE 23RD HEAD CAR, DERAILING6 CARS.  AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT TRANSIENT AC VOLTAGES PRESENT ON SEVERAL OF THE SIGNAL CIRCUITS AT THE CP CAUSING ARCING BETWEEN CIRCUITS AND FIRING LIGHTNING ARRESTERS.ONE CIRCUIT EFFECTED WAS THE SWITCH CONTROL CIRCUIT, WHICH APPARENTLY MOVED TO THE REVERSE POSITION.  IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THE WR RELAY BECAME FALSELY ENERGIZED WHEN AN ARC MOMENTARILY PROVIDED A CURRENT PATH BYPASSING THE DETECTOR AND ROUTE LOCKING CONTACTS IN THE CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR THE WR RELAY.  THIS WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE SWITCH MACHINE TO UNLOCK AND MOVE IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION.  SEVERAL POSSIBLE SOURCES FOR THE TRANSIENT AC VOLTAGES WERE REMOVED AND A LOSS OF SHUNT TIMER WAS INSTALLED FOR THE \"OS\" TRACK CIRCUITS.  ALL APPLICABLE TESTS WERE THEN PERFORMED.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"5","Class Code":"1L","Class":"1L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0706LA053200607","Report Key":"UP0706LA053200607","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 -
