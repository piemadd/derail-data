AT APPROXIMATELY 0245 HOURS, THE TRAIN PASSED GREENWOOD (MILEPOST CA 198.9), A CARABOUT 60 CARS DEEP IN THE CONSIST, HAD BRAKE RIGGING DRAGGING ON THE BALL OF THE RAIL.  THIS EQUIPMENT WAS POSSIBLY DRAGGING FOR SEVERAL MILES BEFORE MILEPOST CA 198.9.  THE DRAGGING EQUIPMENT APPARENTLY CAUSED A FOLLOWING CAR (CSXT 387566) TO DERAIL A WHEEL.  THIS OCCURRED ON THE HIGH SIDE OF A LEFT HAND CURVE.  AT THE WEST END OF AFTON SIDING (MILEPOST CA 204.1), A SECOND WHEEL DERAILED; THEREWAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE SWITCH: CLOSURE RAIL PULLED OUT OF PLATES, FROG BOLT BROKEN, FIVE HEELBLOCKS BROKEN, AND CONNECTING RODS BENT CAUSING THE SWITCH POINT TO GAP.  THERE WAS SUSPENSION SPRINGS LEFT AT THE SWITCH LOCATION (INDICATING WHEEL[S] ON THE GROUND).  THE TRAIN PROCEEDED (WITH TWOWHEELS ON THE GROUND) TO MILEPOST CA 207.8 WHERE THREE CARS TOTALLY LEFT THE RAILS AND 7 CARS BEHINDHAD DIFFERING NUMBERS OF WHEELS ON THE GROUND.  TWO BRIDGES, OVER CITY STREETS AND ANOTHER RAILROAD, HAD WALKWAYS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF EACH BRIDGE, TORN OUT.  ONE CAR CAUGHT A SECURITY FENCE AROUND TWO RAILROAD BUILDINGS.  THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THIS CYCLONE FENCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE GENERAL PILE-UP.  THE FENCE APPEARS TO HAVE CAUGHT MATERIAL ON THE GROUND AND PULLED THE CAR TOTALLY OFF THE RAIL.  AT THAT POINT, THE BRAKE AIR LINE WAS BROKEN; THE TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY.
