ONLY A PORTION OF THE RAIL AT THIS LOCATION WAS LOADED BECAUSE IT WAS STARTING TO SPRINKLE RAIN. AS THE PROGRESS RAIL TRUCK TRAVELED EAST, CARRYING 63 RAILS APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET IN LENGTH EACH, THEY CALLED OUT MP 35 AND EVERYTHING SEEMED OK. THE NEXT THING CSX FOREMAN HEARD WAS THE GRAPPLE TRUCK OPERATORS SAYING THAT THEY LOST CONTROL AND WERE SLIDING AND PICKING UP SPEED. CSX FOREMAN DOES NOT RECALL HEARING THEM REPORT BY MP 34. WHEN THE PROGRESS RAIL SUPERVISOR WHO WAS ON THE RAIL 2 MILES AHEAD OF THE LARGE TRUCK HEARD WHAT WAS HAPPENING HE GOT OFF THE RAIL AT MP BAH-29.8. HE WATCHED THE PROGRESS RAIL TRUCK GO BY. THE PROGRESS RAIL TRUCK TRAVELED 2130 FEET PAST THE CROSSING WHERE IT DERAILED AT MP 29.4 WENT 80 FEET OVER THE NORTH SIDE OF THE BRIDGE.
