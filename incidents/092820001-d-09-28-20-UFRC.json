THE ON SITE PERMIT HOLDER(TRACK ACCESS PERMIT F20-1350) CALLED THE FRONTRUNNER DISPATCHER ABOUT 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE DOCUMENTED START TIME TO ACTIVATE THE PERMIT AND ALSO EXPECTING THAT THE TRACK WOULD BE OUT OF SERVICE SOTHAT THEY COULD SET ON WITH A BOX TRUCK AND HI-RAIL. THE DISPATCHER ALLOWED THE PERMIT TO BE ACTIVESTATING ON THE PHONE: “ I WILL SHOW YOU GUYS ON AT TWO TWO TEN”. AT THIS POINT, TWO OTHER CRITICAL ELEMENTS WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY EVALUATED BY THE DISPATCHER: THE LOCATION OF TRAIN 3 (SCHEDULED TO PASSTHE CONTRACTOR WORK ZONE BEFORE THE WORK PERMIT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED AT 2220HRS) AND APPLYINGTDX SOFTWARE ‘BLUE BLOCKS’ FOR ON TRACK SAFETY – TRACK OUT OF SERVICE AS REQUIRED ON THE PERMIT ANDBY POLICY.  THE SOUTHBOUND TRAIN STRUCK THE HI-RAIL VEHICLE ABOUT 30 FEET SOUTH OF THE CLOSEST GRADE CROSSING (NOT ON THE CROSSING). THE 4 PERSON HIRAIL CREW EXITED THE VEHICLE PRIOR TO THE COLLISIONAND WERE NOT INJURED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES TO THE CREW OR PASSENGERS ON THE TRAIN.
