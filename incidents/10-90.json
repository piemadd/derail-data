THE ENGINEER ON THE LEADING END OF THE MOVEMENT OPERATING FROM THE 1066 WAS TOLD TO PULL FORWARD ONTO THE LEAD IN REALIZING THE HITCH WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL LEAVINGTHE 1054 STILL ON TRACK 15. THE ASSISTANT CONDUCTOR WHO HAD BOARDED THE REVERSE MOVE ONTO TRACK 13 WAS POSITIONED ON THE BLIND SIDE AND DIDNOT NOTICE THAT THE 1054 HAD ROLLED INTO A FOULING POSITION BETWEEN TRACKS 15 AND 13. AT THAT POINT IMPACT WAS INEVITABLE AND COLLISION OCCURRED. THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE INCIDENT PROVIDED SUFFICIENT FACTS FOR REASONABLE CAUSE TESTINGAND ALL THREE CREW MEMBERS WERE TAKEN FOR D & A TESTING. THE RESULTS PROVIDED BY THE TEST WERE NEGATIVE FOR ALL CREW MEMBERS INVOLVED.
