THIS TRAIN CONSISTED OF 2 LOCOMOTIVES AND 54 CARS.  THE MOVEMENT WAS A PROTECTED SHOVING MOVE.  THE TRAIN MOVED FROM THE BBRR MAIN TRACK TO THE CO SIDING AT DOSWELL (CA 113.6) AND PROCEEDED TO THE WYE TRACK.  TRAIN SPEED AT THIS POINT WAS APPROXIMATELY 5 MPH.  AT THIS LOCATION IS A SWITCH TO THE DEPOT TRACK, WHICH RUNS ALONGSIDE THE WYE TRACK.  WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE RAIN AND FOG WITH A FEW INCHES OF RAIN ALREADY DOWN.  JUST BEYOND THE FROG OF THIS SWITCH AND INTO A CURVE, THE TIE AND BALLAST CONDITION WAS POOR.  AS THELOADED CARS CONTINUED OVER THIS SECTION OF TRACK, THE OUTER RAIL OF THE CURVE SEPARATED FROM THE TIES AND TURNED OVER, SNAPPING NEAR THE FROG.
