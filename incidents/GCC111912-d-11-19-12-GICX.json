THE GRR LEAD CONSIST OF TIGHT RADIUS CURVE WITH A SWITCH CONTAINED MIDWAY OF THE CURVE, WHICH LEADS INTO 2 ADDITIONAL SWITCHES SEPARATED BY AN INDUSTRY ROAD CROSSING. WHEN PUSHING THE 8 CARS THROUGH THE INITIAL CURVE, THE SECOND TRUCK OF THE THIRD CAR DERAILED JUST PAST THE INITIAL SWITCH. THE TRAIN CONSISTED OF TWO LOADED HAZARDOUS LIQUID TANK CARS, TWO EMPTY HOPPER CARS AND WAS BEING PUSHED BY THE LOCOMOTIVE. THERE WERE NO RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS LIQUID FROM THE RAILCARS OR THE LOCOMOTIVE. AFTER THE DERAILMENT A 12\" PIECE OF THE SWITCH POINT, ABOUT 2\" IN WIDTH WAS FOUND LAYING ON THE TRACKS. BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF BOTH EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IT WAS DETERMINED THAT DRUGS AND ALCOHOL WERENOT INVOLVED, AND TESTING WAS NOT WARRANTED. AFTER CONSULTING SEVERAL RAIL CONSULTANTS, IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT EMPTY CARS CONTAINED IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONSIST MAY HAVE INCREASED THE RISK OF DERAILMENT. WE HAVE SINCE IMPLEMENTED A POLICY WHICH ALLOWS NO MORE THAN ONE EMPTY CAR IN A CONSIST WHENPUSHING INTO THE GRR LEAD.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"GICXGCC111912201211","Report Key":"GICXGCC111912201211","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Switching and Terminal","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"GICX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Giant Cement","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Switching and Terminal","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"GICX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Giant Cement","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
