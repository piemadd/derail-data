THERE WERE EXTENSIVE STUDIES AND FIELD MEASUREMENTS PERFORMED INTHE ANALYSIS PROCESS OF THIS DERAILMENT AND THE CAUSE WAS GENERATED BASED ON THE FACTS.  THE DETAILED ANALYSIS DID NOT GENERATE ANY DEVATIONS FROM THE STANDARDS.  THE ANALYSIS FOUND THAT THERE WAS NOT A DEFINITIVE DEVIATION THAT WOULD BE CAUSATIVE FOR THE DERAILMENT, THE DERAILMENT WAS A RESULT OFA NUMBER OF PARAMETERS INTERACTING.  THE FOLLOWING WRITE-UP IS THE MORE DETAILED WRITE-UP THAT WAS DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION.  PROGRESSIVE WEAKENING OF THE TRACK STRUCTURE DUE TO: THEINFLUENCE OF TRAIN DYNAMIC UPLIFT; INCREASED LATERAL LOADS FROM GAUGE WIDENING (1/2\");  INCREASED THERMAL FORCES IN THE RAIL; THE INFLUENCE OF THE HEAVY VERTICAL CAR LOADS; AND THE CURVATURE EFFECTS.THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRACK STRUCTURE AND THE TRAIN PARAMETERS CAUSED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRAIN INDUCED MISALIGNMENT.  THE MISALIGNMENT GREW TO A POINT WHERE THE WHEEL ON THE CAR NORX3174 R2 CLIMED OVER THE TOP OF THE RAIL.  IN DEPTH ANALYSIS VERIFIED THAT THIS WAS NOT A TRACK BUCKLE.NoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"4","Class Code":"1L","Class":"1L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0602CB003200206","Report Key":"UP0602CB003200206","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
