THE RCO DISMOUNTED HIS LOCOMOTIVE AND WALKED NORTHEAST AHEAD OF HIS CONSIST TO LINE THE SWITCH FOR HIS MOVEMENT AND PROTECT THE ROAD CROSSING. DURING HIS NORTHWESTERN MOVEMENT, HE COMMANDEDHIS RCO BOX TO MOVE HIS CONSIST TO WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS NORTHEAST. WHEN HE LOOKED BACK AT HIS LOCOMOTIVE, HE REALIZED THAT HE MISTAKENLY COMMANDED HIS CONSIST TO MOVE SOUTHWEST. THIS SOUTHWESTERN MOVEMENT CAUSED EMPTY I/L 156 TO GO THROUGH A SET OF SKATES, A BUMPING POST, AND A JERSEY BARRIER.  THE MASSIVE IMPACT CAUSED THE LADLE TO DERAIL.
