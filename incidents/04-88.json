THE TRAIN, OPERATING FROM CAR 625, WAS BETWEEN CAISSON NUMBER THREE AND CAISSONONE AT SIGNAL #502. THE MOTORMAN CHANGED POSITION BUT STILL COULD NOT GET CONTROLLER POWER OR GET HIS INDICATION. HE THEN REPORTED THAT ONE OF THE CARS IN THE TRAIN HAD DERAILED. AFTER REVIEWING THE TRACK AREA AT THE LOCATION OF THE DERAILMENT AND AFTER EXAMINING THE EQUIPMENT INVOLVED (CARS 801 & 608) IT IS THE CONCLUSION OF PATH'S STAFF THAT THE DERAILMENT RESULTED FROM A STIFF TRUCK ON PA-4 CAR801. THIS CONCLUSION WAS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED WITH J.J. RYAN, MANAGER OF THE FRA OFFICE AT NEWARK, NEWJERSEY ON APRIL 4, 1988. ON THE FOLLOWING DAY, HE SENT FRA INSPECTOR, JIM LOFTUS TO EXAMINE CAR 801WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THE TRUCK INVOLVED. INSPECTOR LOFTUS AGREED WITH PATH'S CONCLUSION THATTHE TRUCK WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT.NoneNoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"PATH288198804","Report Key":"PATH288198804","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 -
