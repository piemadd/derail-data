AS THEY PASSED OVERTHE 848 SWITCH, THE LEAD AXLE OF THE 2ND UNIT IMPACTED THE SWITCH POINT CAUSING THE WHEELS TO CLIMBAND EVENTUALLY DROP OUTSIDE THE RAIL. THE FIRST SET OF TRUCKS ON THE FIRST CAR ( TOBX889044 ) ALSOFOLLOWED THE SAME PATH DERAILING THE A END BEFORE GETTING STOPPED. AFTER INVESTIGATION THE CAUSE ISDETERMINED TO BE A COMBINATION OF STIFF TRUCKS ON THE LOCOMOTIVE AND THE SWITCH POINTS RAISING UP WHEN THE WHEELS HIT THE HEEL BLOCK. THE FUEL TANK ON THE 1502 WAS PUNCTERED AND WE LOST 20 TO 30 GALLONS OF FUEL.
