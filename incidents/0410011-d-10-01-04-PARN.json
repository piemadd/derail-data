CONDUCTOR AND ENGINEER BROUGHT ENGINE 90 POINTEDNORTH WITH TWO FLAT CARS (490, 1016) NORTH OF ENGINE EMPTY CEMENT TRUCK ON NORTH FLAT CAR, SOUTH FROM POURING CEMENT AT 15 MILE.  CONTINUE SOUTH THROUGH THE POCKET SWITCH ONTO TRACK SIX TO PICK UP FOUR PASSENGER COACHES, 207, 282, 288, 274.  THEY MAKE THE JOINT WITH ENGINE 90'S COUPLER AND PROCEED NORTH.  CONDUCTOR RIDES COACHES UP TO THE POCKET, ENGINEER GETS THE SWITCH AND CONDUCTOR GETS OFF THECOACHES AND ONTO NORTH FLAT TO MAKE THE SPOT.  THEY CONTINUE UP ONTO THE FUEL SPUR TO SPOT ON THE RAMP TO UNLOAD EMPTY CEMENT TRUCK.  ENGINEER WATCHES THE FOUR COACHES IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR UNTIL THEY ARE READY TO SPOT THE FLAT/CEMENT TRUCK.  THEY MAKE THE SPOT AND WHEN THEY LOOK BACK THE COACHESARE GONE.  THE COACHES GO BACK TO THE COACH YARD THE WAY THEY WERE LINED AND RUN INTO A STANDING SETOF SEVEN CARS 284, 278, 220, 218, 226, 222, 216.  BOTH COUPLERS REMAINED CLOSED WHEN EQUIPMENT CAMETO REST.  IT IS SPECULATED THAT A PROBABLE CAUSE WAS THAT THE COUPLER PIN ON THE COACH (207) NEXT TO THE ENGINE MAY HAVE HAD ITS LIFT LINKAGE BIND AND WHEN THE CURVE OF THE FUEL SPUR, AS SOON AS THERE WAS SLACK AT THE SPOT, THE PIN LIFTED.  THIS ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE OLD MAIN SWITCH IN THE POCKET WAS NOT RELINED TO THE OLD MAIN BECAUSE THE MOVE WAS IN PROGRESS, ALLOWED THE COACHES TO RETURN TO THE COACH YARD.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"PARN0410011200410","Report Key":"PARN0410011200410","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Tourist, Excursion, Historical","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 - Commuter West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"PARN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Pacific & Arctic Railroad & Navigation Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Tourist, Excursion, Historical","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 - Commuter West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"PARN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Pacific & Arctic Railroad & Navigation Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
