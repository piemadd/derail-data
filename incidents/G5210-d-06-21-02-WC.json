ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS ON THE TRUCK WERE CONDEMNABLE UNDER FRA OR AAR STANDARDS, THE COMBINATION OF WEAR ON MULTIPLE COMPONENTS CAUSED THE CAR TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANY MINOR DEVIATIONS TRACK CONDITION AT A 15 FOOT INTERVAL (TRUCK CENTERS)AND /OR TRAIN SPEED.  THE LOSS OFFREE LATERAL CAUSED BY THE CONVERSION OF THE FRICTION BEARING TRUCKS TO ROLLER BEARING TRUCKS FURTHER INCREASES THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TRUCK TO TRACK DEVIATION AND TRAIN HANDLING.  THE TRACK AT AND LEADING UP TO THE POINT OF DERAILMENT FALLS WELL WITHIN THE STANDARDS FOR CLASS 3 TRACK.  THERE IS AREDUCTION OF 3/8\" IN THE SUPER ELEVATION AT THE POINT OF DERAILMENT FORM A POINT 15\"- 6\" SOUTH OF THE POINT OF DERAILMENT.  IN A NORMAL TRUCK THIS  WOULD TEND TO PLACE MORE FORCE AGAINST THE HIGH RAILBUT WITH THE SHORT 15' TRUCK CENTERS IT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF UNLOADING THE NORTH END OF THE CARAS THE SOUTH END OF THE CAR PASSED OVER THE AREA OF GREATER SUPER ELEVATION.NoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"WCG5210200206","Report Key":"WCG5210200206","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America"}
