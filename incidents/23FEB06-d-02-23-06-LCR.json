THE TRAIN WAS OPERATED BY THE LAKE COUNTYRAILROAD (LCR) AND I WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF THAT CARRIER. IT WAS A COOL WINTER DAY AND SUN WAS SHINING.WE HAD 10 CARS IN THE TRAIN ; (7) COVERED HOPPERS FILLED PERLITE AMD (3) CENTER BEAMS HAULING LUMBER.  WE HAD TRAVELED 44 MILES FROM INITIAL TERMINAL.  WE HAD BEEN ON DUTY 6 HRS AND  30 MINS. I WAS CHECKING THE STATUS OF THE TRAIN FROM THE CONDUCTOR'S STATION WHILE THE TRAIN WAS NEGOTIATING A LEFTHAND CURVE.  I SAW THE REAR OF THE FIRST CAR (HEAD END) OR THE FRONT OF THE SECOND CAR DERAIL AND START TRACKING ON THE TIES.  I INFORMED THE ENGINEER THAT THE TRAIN WAS  ON THE GROUND.  HE MOVED THEAIR CONTROLS AND REPEATED THAT WE WEE ON THE GROUND.  ENGINEER ACKNOWLEDGED ME AND STATED HE WAS GETTING THE TRAIN STOPPED.  I'M NOT SURE OF THE TRAIN SPEED BECAUSE A SPEEDOMETE WAS NOT VISIBLE TO ME.WE WERE MOVING PRETTY SLOW. AFTER THE TRAIN STOPPED WE CHECKED THE SITUATION AND FOUND (5) FIVE  CARS DERAILED.  WE WERE UNABLE TO CONTACT ANYONE DUE TO THE RADIO WAVES IN THE CANYON.  WE PULLLED THE LOCOMOTIVES AWAY FROM THE CARS AND PULLED FARTHER SOUTH UNTIL WE HAD GOOD CELL PHONE INDICATORS  AT THAT TIME LCR SUPERINTENDENT WAS PASSING THE SITE AND CALLED US TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPEN.  WE MET BACK AT THE SCENE AND GATES INSTRUCTED US TO PULL THE LOCOMOTIVE DOWN TO A CLEARING AND SECURE IT.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"3","Class":"3","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"LCR23FEB06200602","Report Key":"LCR23FEB06200602","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"LCR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Lake County Railroad","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"LCR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Lake County Railroad","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
