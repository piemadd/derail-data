AFTER SETTING THAT CAR OUT, THE CREW PULLED SEVEN EMPTY GONDOLAS FROM THE B.O.F. SCRAP YARD WHICH WERE GOING TO BE WEIGHTED ALONG WITH THE EMPTY CARBIDE CAR. AS THE CREW WAS SHOVING THE EMPTY GONDOLAS NORTH ON TRACK 79A, THE EMPTY CARBIDE CAR, NAHX 99760, BEGAN TO ROLL NORTH ON TRACK 500 ALSO. THE TRAINMAN RIDING THE HIND-END OF THE DRAG OF GONDOLAS SAW THIS OCCUR AND ALLEGEDLY GAVE A SIGNAL TO HIS CREW MEMBERS, ALL OF WHOM WERE IN THE LOCOMOTIVE CAB, TO STOPTHE SHOVING MOVEMENT BECAUSE THE HIND CAR WAS HEADING TOWARD A COLLISION WITH THE CARBIDE CAR AT THE 500/79A TRACK SWITCH. SINCE THERE WAS NO RESPONSE TO THE SIGNAL AND THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED, THE TRAINMAN DISMOUNTED THE CAR AND RAN FROM THE IMMEDIATE AREA. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT REVEALED THAT THE CREW INDICATED THEY PLACED A BLOCK UNDER A WHEEL OF NAHX 99760 WHEN IT WAS PLACED ON TRACK 500. THEY FAILED TO SET A HAND BRAKE ON THE CAR WHICH ALONG WITH THE FAILURE TO HAVE THE CREW MEMBERS PROPERLY POSITIONED ON THE DRAG OF GONDOLAS BEING SHOVED, WERE THE MAIN FACTORS.NoneNoneNone","Joint
