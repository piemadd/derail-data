CAUSE OF THIS DERAILMENT IS DUE TOIMPROPER HANDLING OF AUTOMATIC AND DYNAMIC BRAKES WHILE TRAVELING ON A .75 DESCENDING GRADE.  THE ENGINEER RELEASED THE AIR AND AT THE SAME TIME RAPIDLY REDUCED THE THROTTLE FROM 8 NOTCH TO IDLE, THEN TRANSITIONING INTO DYNAMIC BRAKE.  THIS CAUSED THE 86 CAR TRAIN TO GO FROM A SLACK STRETCHED CONDITION TO A SLACK BUNCHED CONDITION CREATING EXCESSIVE IN-TRAIN BUFF FORCES, WHICH DEVELOPED ENOUGH FORCE TO CAUSE THE 15TH CAR FROM THE HEAD END TO CLIMB THE HIGH SIDE OF A 3 DEGREE 10 MINUTE CURVE.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"3","Class":"3","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"ICE2003300200311","Report Key":"ICE2003300200311","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian Pacific Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian Pacific Railway Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
