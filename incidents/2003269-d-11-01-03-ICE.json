UPON INSPECTING THE TRAIN, IT WAS FOUNDTHAT 6 CARS HAD DERAILED.  AFTER INSPECTING THE CARS AND THE RAIL INVOLVED IN THIS DERAILMENT, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE RAIL HEAD BEING WORN TO THE SAME PROFILE AS THE WHEELS CAUSED MORE THAN NORMAL CONTACT BETWEEN THE WHEEL FLANGE, TREAD, AND RAIL CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A SLACK RUN IN TO CAUSE THE WHEEL TO CLIMB THE RAIL.  WHEN THE SLACK RAN IN, THE WHEEL DID CLIMB OVER THE RAIL - A CASE OF LATERAL FORCES EXCEEDING VERTICAL FORCES.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"3","Class":"3","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"ICE2003269200311","Report Key":"ICE2003269200311","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian Pacific Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian Pacific Railway Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
