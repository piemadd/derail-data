AFTERTHE SWITCH WAS LINED, THE BRAKEMAN INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER TO \"GIVE ME A PIN,\" TO SEPARATE THE CABOOSE FROM THE TRAIN SO THAT THE CABOOSE COULD ROLL INTO THE LONG PASS TRACK.  THE TRAIN TRAVELED APPROXIMATELY 1 TO 1 1/2 CAR LENGTHS AND THEN WENT INTO EMERGENCY (DYNAMITED).   THERE WAS COMMUNICATIONBETWEEN THE CONDUCTOR AND ENGINEER AS TO WHAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURE.  THE ENGINEER THEN BEGAN TO TROUBLESHOOT AND TRY TO GAIN HIS AIR BACK IN THE TRAIN LINE SYSTEM.  HE NOTICED THEAIR GAUGE DROPPING SLIGHTLY.  THE CONDUCTOR BEGAN WALKING THE TRAIN TO SEE IF THERE WAS AN AIR HOSEUNCOUPLED.  HE WALKED APPROXIMATELY 25 CARS BEFORE DISCOVERING THE SITE OF THE DERAILMENT.
