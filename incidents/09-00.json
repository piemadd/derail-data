TRAIN 159 THEN PROCEEDED TO TRACK #8 TO LIFT MORE CARS TO SWITCH ON TOP OF CARS IN THE MAIN TRACK.  WHILE PULLING 44 CARS EASTWARD ON THE LEAD TRACK (ADJACENT TO MAIN TRACK), LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER OBSERVED CUT OF CARS ON THE ADJACENT MAIN TRACK TO BE CLOSE, BUT CONTINUED TO PULL EASTWARD.  WHEN TRAIN 159 REACHED THE CLEARANCE POINT, LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER HEARD A SCRAPING SOUND AND SUBSEQUENTLY BROUGHT HIS MOVEMENT TO A STOP.  INITIAL INSPECTION REVEALED THAT TRAIN 159 HAD SIDESWIPED EASTERNMOST CUT OF CARS.  IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DEVELOPED THAT THE CUT OF CARS HAD ROLLED EASTWARD, RESULTING IN THE EASTERNMOST CAR FOULING THE LEAD TRACK.  NO DERAILMENT OF UNIT/CARS WAS INCURRED HOWEVER, DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT RESULTED IN MISHAP MEETING FRA REPORTING THRESHOLD.  NO TRACK DAMAGE OR INJURIES WERE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF INCIDENT.
