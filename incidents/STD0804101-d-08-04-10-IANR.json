THE CREW TRAVELLED THE MAIN TRACK TO PLACE AN EOT ONTO THE REAR NORTHERN MOST CAR. AS THE EOT WAS PLACED THE CREW OBSERVED THAT THEREAR CAR WAS APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET FROM THE DERAIL. THE CONDUCTOR VERIFIED THAT THE REAR CAR HAD AHAND BRAKE APPLIED SO THEY WENT BACK TO THE SOUTH END OF THE TRACK AND COUPLED INTO IT. THE CONDUCTOR CUT IN THE AIR AND RELEASED THE HAND BRAKES FROM THE CARS ON THE SOUTH END OF THE TRACK. AT THIS POINT IT SHALL BE NOTED THAT THE TRACK HAS A “CROWN” PROFILE IN THE MIDDLE, SO WHEN THE CREW CUT IN THE AIR AND RELEASED THE BRAKES THE SLACK RAN OUT IN BOTH DIRECTIONS FROM THE PEAK. THE HAND BRAKES ON THE NORTH END OF TRACK DID NOT SECURE THE CARS SUFFICIENTLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE SLACK FROM RUNNING OUT CAUSING THE REAR WHEEL TO MOVE OVER THE DERAIL. THE CREW THEN MADE A PULL FORWARD WITH THE REAR CAR DERAILED.","Joint Track Type":"Siding","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"IANRSTD0804101201008","Report Key":"IANRSTD0804101201008","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 - Commuter West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"IANR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Iowa Northern Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 - Commuter West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"IANR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Iowa Northern Railway Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
