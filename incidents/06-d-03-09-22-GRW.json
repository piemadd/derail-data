THE RCO WAS RIDING ON THE PLATFORM OF THE LEAD LADLE WHEN HE HEARD A LOUD POP AND IMMEDIATELY COMMANDED STOP ON HIS REMOTE.  THE RCO INVESTIGATED THE NOISE AND DISCOVERED THAT HISTRAIN HAD DERAILED MULTIPLE AXLES ON THE SOUTH RAIL UNDER THE LADLES.  THE RCO CONTACTED THE SCALESYARDMASTER, WHO THEN NOTIFIED THE TRAINMASTER.\r\nTHERE HAD RECENTLY BEEN A GAUGE SPOT THAT WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE MOW TRACK INSPECTOR.  A REPAIR WAS MADE TO ADDRESS THE GAUGE ISSUE THAT SAME DAY.  PLANSWERE MADE TO BUILD AND INSTALL TRACK PANELS THROUGH THE CROSSING DURING THE COURSE OF AN OUTAGE ATTHE END OF MARCH.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE TRACK AFTER THE DERAILMENT, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE INITIALREPAIRS MADE ON MARCH 1ST WERE INSUFFICIENT.  THE LOW SIDE OF THE CURVE WAS GAUGED TO THE NORTH TOWARDS THE HIGH RAIL, BUT THE FIELD SIDE OF THE NORTH RAIL WAS NOT DUG OUT TO VERIFY THE TIE CONDITION.AFTER CLEANING OFF THE FIELD SIDE OF THE NORTH RAIL, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THERE WAS BROKEN OR MISSING PLATES IN THE AREA ALONG WITH DEFECTIVE TIES. THE MISSING AND BROKEN TIES PLATES, ALONG WITH TIECONDITION, WOULD HAVE CONSTITUTED THE NEED FOR TIES TO BE REPLACED INSTEAD OF GAUGING THE SOUTH RAILTO MAKE THE CORRECT REPAIR UNTIL THE PANELS COULD BE INSTALLED.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"GRW06202203","Report Key":"GRW06202203","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"GRW","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Gary Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Transtar","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"GRW","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Gary Railway Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Transtar"}
