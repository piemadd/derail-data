THE CONSIST WAS IN PUSH/PULL CONFIGURATION BY FEC FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVE #507. AS THE TRAIN CONSIST THEN ENTEREDTHE YARD AND THE “B” TRUCK OF BRIGHTLINE LOCOMOTIVE #102, #3 AXLE DERAILED NORTH OF SWITCH CAUSING AXLE #4 TO FOLLOW. BOTH GEARBOXES WERE DAMAGED. THE FOLLOWING COACH TRUCK STAYED ON THE CORRECT RAIL.NO DEFINITIVE CAUSE FOR DERAILMENT HAS YET BEEN IDENTIFIED ALTHOUGH SOME ANOMALIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT COULD BE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL LAYOUT OF THE TRACK WAS NOT IDEAL, RESULTINGIN VERY SHARP EFFECTIVE TRACK CURVATURE AT THE POD, ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD NORMALLY BE EXPECTED TO GENERATE THE LARGEST EFFECT (LARGEST AOA) ON AXLE 1. THE SWITCH POINT WAS NEW WITH VERY ROUGH SURFACESTHAT WOULD LEAD TO A HIGH EFFECTIVE COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION. THIS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT ON ALL AXLES. THE TRACK WHERE THE DERAILMENT OCCURRED WAS REALIGNED ON FEBRUARY 21, 2017. THE TRACK THROUGH THE MAIN ROUTE OF THE SWITCH WAS STRAIGHTENED AND CURVATURE PRIOR TO THE SWITCH WASINCREASED. THE DERAILED TRUCK OF LOCOMOTIVE 102 WAS REPLACED AND RETURNED TO SIEMENS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS AND REPAIR. LOCOMOTIVE 102 WAS RETESTED AND CONFIRMED TO BE READY FOR FURTHER DYNAMIC TESTING.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"No","Class":"No","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"BLF201702001201702","Report Key":"BLF201702001201702","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"BLF","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Brightline Train","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"BLF","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Brightline Train","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
