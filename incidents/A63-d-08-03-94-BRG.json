S23 IS THE INSIDE TRK, CLOSEST TO THEMAIN LINE & S25 IS THE OUTSIDE TRK, FURTHEST FROM THE MAIN LINE. THE SWITCH CREW WENT INTO S25 WITHA LIGHT ENGINE. S23 HAD SEVERAL EMPTY RAIL CARS THAT HAD BEEN IN STORAGE FOR SEVERAL DAYS. AS SWITCH CREW WAS PULLING OUT RAIL CARS FROM S25, THE CONDUCTOR HEARD A STRANGE NOISE & FELT A STRONG GUSTOF WIND (THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CLOUDY WITH THUNDERSTORMS & A FUNNEL WAS REPORTED IN THE PORT AREA). IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS THE CONDUCTOR, POSITIONED NEAR MIDDLE OF TRK S25, HEARD A LOUD NOISE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A COLLISION & RADIOED THE ENGINEER TO STOP. AFTER INVESTIGATING THE TRAIN, CONDUCTORFOUND RAIL CARS THAT HAD BEEN STORED ON S23 HAD ROLLED INDEPENDENTLY ONTO RAIL CARS THE CREW WAS PULLING OUT OF S25. CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS UNDETERMINABLE.
