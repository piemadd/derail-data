THE CARS WERE BEING SWITCHED FROM THE MAIN LINE TRACK THROUGH A TURNOUT AND INTO AN INDUSTRYTRACK.  APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THE TRAIN WAS ON THE MAIN LINE AND ONE-HALF WAS ON THE INDUSTRY TRACK AT THE TIME THAT THE DRAFT GEAR CAME OUT OF CAR WC 26124.  RE-ENACTING THE INCIDENT SHOWED THATTHE FORCES OF THE TRAIN ALONG WITH THE GRADES WERE NOT ENOUGH TO CAUSE THIS DRAFT GEAR TO MALFUNCTION.  THE SIMULATION OF THE EVENT SHOWED THAT THE DRAFT GEAR (DRAFT SILL) MUST HAVE BEEN IN A WEAKENED CONDTION TO ALLOW A MODERATE LEVEL OF FORCE TO CAUSE THE DRAFT GEAR TO COME OUT OF THE CAR.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SSAMS0012199803","Report Key":"SSAMS0012199803","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"SSAM","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"SAULT STE.
