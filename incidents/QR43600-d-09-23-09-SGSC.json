USE OF THIS FIXED DERAIL WAS IN VIOLATION OF RAILROADS SPECIAL INSTRUCTION #6 AND DID NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION TO THE LOCOMOTIVE MECHANIC.  THE CONDUCTOR FAILED TO NOTIFY THE ENGINEER THAT HE HAD ACTIVATED THE DERAILS.  AFTER THE LOCOMOTIVE HAD BEEN COMPLETED THE CREW (ENGINEER, CONDUCTOR AND BRAKEMAN) RETURNED TOWORK.  THE FIRST MOVE WAS TO THE SOUTH TO COUPLE INTO 22 CARS ON TRACK 218.  AFTER COUPLING, THE CONDUCTOR MADE A CUT AT CAR 18 OF THE STRING.

THE CONDUCTOR REMAINED AT THE BOTTOM END OF THE MOVEMENT AND THE BRAKEMAN WAS POSITIONED AT THE THE TRACK 20 SWITCH.  A 10 CAR COUNT WAS GIVEN FOR THEPULLING MOVE WITH THE ENGINEER POSITIONED AT THE LEADING END OF THE MOVEMENT.  THE ENGINEER FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE ACTIVATED DERAIL.  AFTER  TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 4 CAR LENGTHS, THE LOCOMOTIVE STRUCK THE DERAIL.  THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED AN ADDITIONAL 180 FEET.  THE 2ND CAR IN THE CONSIST, CPCX 805042, WAS DERAILED.  THE 3RD CAR IN THE CONSIST, GOCX 58710, WAS ALSO DERAILED.  WHEN GOCX 58710 BEGAN TO ROCK AND TIP OVER, CPCX 805042 WAS PULLED OVER, FOLLOWED BY LOCOMOTIVE GMTX 2002.
