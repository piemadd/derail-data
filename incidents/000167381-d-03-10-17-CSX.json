DYNAMIC BRAKING AND THROTTLE MODULATIONWERE BEING USED MAINTAINING A SPEED BETWEEN 26 AND 30 MPH. ENGINEER STATED HE NEEDED TO USE THE BATHROOM AND DECIDED TO STOP THE TRAIN TO DO SO. HIS FIRST ACTION TO SLOW THE TRAIN WAS BY MAKING A 10PSI BRAKE PIPE REDUCTION FOLLOWED BY BUNCHING THE SLACK USING DYNAMIC BRAKING. THE DYNAMIC BRAKE WASAPPLIED TO FULL DYNAMIC FROM DYNAMIC POSITION ONE WITHIN 14 SECONDS AND THE AUTOMATIC BRAKE WAS REDUCED TWO MORE POUNDS TO 78 PSI DURING THAT TIME. THE PROPER WAY TO SLOW AND STOP THIS TYPE OF TRAINUSING A BUNCHED SLACK METHOD WOULD BE TO APPLY DYNAMIC BRAKING INCREASING THE BRAKING POSITIONS GRADUALLY TO FULLY BUNCH THE TRAIN?S SLACK THEN MAKE A MINIMUM REDUCTION OF THE AUTOMATIC BRAKE TO APPLYTHE TRAIN?S AIR BRAKES IN A QUICK UNIFORM MANNER THEN MAKE FURTHER BRAKE PIPE REDUCTIONS AS NECESSARY TO STOP THE TRAIN.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"4","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"CSX000167381201703","Report Key":"CSX000167381201703","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation"}
