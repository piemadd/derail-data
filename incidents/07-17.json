THE TRAIN WAS NOT SLOWING DOWN AT THE RATE THAT THE ENGINEER WAS EXPECTING. THE ENGINEER PUT ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS ON THE BRAKE PIPE. HOWEVER, THE ENGINEER DID NOT GIVE THE REDUCTIONS THE PROPER TIME TO EQUALIZE THROUGHOUT THE TRAIN. THE ENGINEER JUST KEPT MAKING A REDUCTION UNTILHE REACHED A FULL-SERVICE APPLICATION. THE DOWNLOAD OF THE LEAD LOCOMOTIVE SHOWED THAT THE HEAD OFTHE TRAIN MADE A 26 PSI REDUCTION, BUT THE EOT SHOWED THE REAR END ONLY MADE A 6 PSI REDUCTION. THERE WAS AN IMBALANCE IN THE BRAKE PIPE AIR PRESSURE THROUGHOUT THE TRAIN. THE ENGINEER, AT 2 MPH, STARTED TO APPLY THE INDEPENDENT BRAKE AND RELEASED THE AUTOMATIC BRAKE. SINCE THE REAR OF THE TRAINS BRAKES WERE NOT REALLY SET, AS THE ENGINEER USED ONLY THE INDEPENDENT BRAKES TO STOP THE TRAIN THE LAST 2 MPH, THE REAR OF THE RAN IN TO THE FRONT OF THE TRAIN, BUNCHING THE CARS TOGETHER. AS THE ENGINEER CAME TO A STOP, THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN WAS SHOVED AHEAD FROM 0 MPH TO 3 MPH WITHIN A MATTER OF A SECOND, DUE TO THE RUN IN. THE TRAIN THEN REDUCED ITS SPEED TO A STOP. AT THIS POINT, THE IN-LINE TRAIN FORCES CAUSED A SET OF TRUCKS ON AN AUTO RACK TO JUMP THE RAIL JUST PAST A CURVE IN THE TRACK, DERAILING THE TRAIN.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"TSWS92020174201707","Report Key":"TSWS92020174201707","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Switching and Terminal","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 -
