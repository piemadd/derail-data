THE OPERATOR PUT THE BOX IN STOP AND THE CREW STARTED WALKING THE TRAIN TO INVESTIGATE.  UPON INVESTIGATION THE CREW FOUND THE LOCOMOTIVE UP509 AND THE HEAD CAR UP210078 DERAILED UPRIGHT.  DERAILMENT OCCURRED DUE TO AN IRREGULAR CURVE WITH RAPID CHANGES CAUSING RAPID INCREASES IN LATERAL & VERTICAL FORCES.  THESE FORCES CAUSED THE RAIL TO ROLL AND EVENTUALLY BREAK UNDER PRESSURE OF THE LOCOMOTIVE PUNCTURING THE FUEL TANK AS WELL.
