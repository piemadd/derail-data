FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS WITH AMTRAK AND THE FRA, HOWEVER, A DETERMINATION WAS MADE TO AMEND THE ORIGINAL FILING TO DESIGNATE THE INCIDENT WITH AN “H” (HUMAN FACTOR) CAUSE CODE. THIS DETERMINATION WASMADE IN SPITE OF THE CREW STATEMENTS TAKEN AT THE SCENE, COUPLED WITH MANAGEMENT’S FOLLOW-UP ANALYSIS OF THE CREW’S PERFORMANCE (AND A JOINT INSPECTION OF THE MECHANICAL CONDITION OF THE RAILCAR), WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT PROPER RULES AND PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED AND THAT THE RAILCAR’S BRAKING APPARATUSES FUNCTIONED PROPERLY.

THE DESCENDING GRADE AT CPN-455 IS .50% DOWN TO 0.0% IN THE BODY OR MIDDLE OF THEYARD TRACK.  THIS REQUIRED THE TRAIN TO TRAVERSE TWO CROSSOVERS FROM MAIN 1 TO MAIN 2 FROM MAIN 2 TOTHE EAST YARD LEAD THEN HEAD INTO YARD #4.  THIS REQUIRED TWO LEFT HAND MOVEMENTS THROUGH THE CROSSOVER AND WAS FOLLOWED BY A RIGHT HAND MOVEMENT DOWN THE LEAD AND THEN A A LEFT HAND MOVEMENT INTO YARD TRACK #4.  AFTER INVESTIGATION, WE FOUND THAT THE TRAIN HANDLING WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT, NOR WERE THERE ANY TRACK ISSUES.  NO ISSUES WITH CARS INVOLVED IN THE DERAILMENT.  INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT A CAR HAD WHEEL LIFT CAUSING THE DERAILMENT.  THIS IS A RESULT OF A COMBINATION OF A TRAIN SIZE, TYPE OF CARS (LONG DRAW BAR), DESCENDING GRADE AND THE APPROACH COMING FROM MAIN LINE #1 INTO THE EAST YARD TRACKS 3 THROUGH 5.  EFFECTIVE JUNE 26 INSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN ISSUED THAT THE TRAINS OF THIS SIZE THAT HAVE BLOCKS HANDLING LONG DRAW BAR CARS (AUTO RACKS, A FRAMES, ETC) ARE TO ONLYBE BROUGHT INTO EAST YARD LEAD TRACK #2 AND AT CP-955 WHICH WILL REDUCE THE ISSUE OF THE APPROACH INTO THE EASY YARD ON WEST BOUND TRAINS WITH LARGE BLOCKS OF LONG DRAW BAR CARS.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0516PC004201605","Report Key":"UP0516PC004201605","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 -
