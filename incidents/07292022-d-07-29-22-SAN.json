AFTER SETTING TWO CARS OUT TO #4 TRACK, THE CO WAS TO SET 2 LOADED CARS (XOMX 720046 & ASHX 1273) BACK INTO #1 TRACK.  THEN DOUBLE BACK TO #4 TRACK WITH 7 MTYS.  THE CO LINEDTO #1 AND SHOVED TWO CAR LENGTHS INTO THE CLEAR AT THE PAINTED CLEARANCE MARK.  HE THEN ASKED FOR SLACK FROM EN AND ALLOWED THE 2 LOADS TO ROLL FREELY APPROX. 475 FT ON A DOWNHILL GRADE WHICH COUPLEDTO A CUT OF CARS IN #1.  WHEN THE 2 LOADS REACHED THE NORTHERN MOST CAR IN #1 TRACK (LOADED CCBX 58569), THE 2 CARS HAD GAINED ENOUGH SPEED TO CAUSE AN OVERSPEED COUPLING ESTIMATED AT 8 MPH.  THIS COUPLING CAUSED THE B-END OF THE LOADED PLASTIC PELLET CAR, CCBX 58569, TO BUCKLE FROM THE IMPACT.  THIS DAMAGED THE CENTERSILL, SIDE SILLS, CAR BODY, AND SAFETY APPLIANCES.  THE IMPACT ALSO CAUSED LATERAL FORCES ON THE 90 LBS EAST RAIL, CAUSING THE RAIL TO ROLL AND BREAK UNDER THE B-END OF THE CCBX 58569 WHICH DERAILED THE L1, L2, R1, R2 WHEELS ON THE CCBX 58569.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SAN07292022202207","Report Key":"SAN07292022202207","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"SAN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Sandersville Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"SAN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Sandersville Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
