THE ENGINEER STOPPED TO HAVE THE NEW SWITCH LINED AFTER LEAVING CPW511.  CREW MOVED APPROXIMATELY 2500 FEET INTO THE NORTH LEAD AND WENT INTO EMERGENCY.  AT THE TIME OF DERAILMENT, THE TRAIN SPEED RECORDED WAS 6 MPH AND IN DYNAMIC4-5.  MPCNP-25 DERAILED FOUR CARS IN CHEYENE YARD, MP 509.52 ON THE LARAMIE SUBDIVISION.  DERAILEDCARS WERE 52, 53, 54 AND 55 OF TRAIN CONSIST.  ENGINEER WAS MODULATING DYNAMIC BRAKES TO ENSURE SPEED COMPLIANCE.  FIRST CAR DERAILED WAS UNABLE TO NAVIGATE TURNOUT, BUT MECHANICAL MEASUREMENTS WERE WITHIN STANDARD.  FROG AT POINT OF DERAILMENT WAS WORN, BUT WITHIN ENGINEERING TOLERANCE.  TRAIN CONSIST HAD LOADS ON THE REAR, BUT MET WITH TRAIN MAKEUP REQUIREMENTS.  ENGINEER OPERATION OF TRAIN WASCOMPLIANT WITH RULE APPLICATION AND NO EXCEPTION TAKEN.  IT IS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO WHY THE FIRST CARFAILED TO NAVIGATE THE TURNOUT.  UPON IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL FACTORS, INVOLING MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT.  THE TRAIN WEIGHT WAS 16.794TONS WITH A LENGTH OF 11,685.

FOLLOWING FRA GUIDELINES, THERE WAS NO REASON TO TEST FOR DRUG OR ALCOHOL INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE WE HAD NO REASONABLE SUSPICION ANDIT WAS NOT GOING TO MEET THER CRITERIA NECESSARY FOR TESTING. WE BELIEVE THE CAUSE FOR THE DERAILMENT WAS WIDE GAUGE DUE TO DETERIORATED TIE CONDITION. THE TRAIN WAS TRAVELING DOWNHILL AND AROUND A CURVE SO THE BRAKES WERE BEING APPLIED. RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE CURVE, THE LAST CAR OF THE TRAIN DROPPEDIN AND TRAVELED ABOUT 150 FEET THEN TRAVELED OUTSIDE THE ROCK BED CAUSING IT TO FLIP AND FLIPPING THE CAR IT WAS COUPLED TO. THIS CAUSED THE TRAIN TO STOP. ALL OTHER CARS REMAINED UPRIGHT AND ON THE RAIL. THERE WAS NO RELEASED OF ANY FUEL OR MATERIAL FROM LOCOMOTIVES OR RAILCARS.
