AFTER PERFORMING WORKAROUND THE YARD AND BRAKE TESTED 72 CARS, THEY DEPARTED TOWARDS CASTLE HAYNE. THE CREW ARRIVED AT THE MARTIN MARIETTA INDUSTRY IN A NORTHBOUND DIRECTION. THE Y20021 WAS NORTH OF THE MARTIN MARIETTA INDUSTRY SWITCH IN A SOUTHBOUND DIRECTION WAITING ON W54220 TO CLEAR INSIDE INDUSTRY. WHEN THE W54220CLEARED, THE Y20021 LINED THE SWITCH FOR STRAIGHT AWAY MOVEMENT TO PROCEED SOUTH TOWARD WILMINGTON.THE CONDUCTOR ON THE W54220 DISMOUNTED AT THE #1 SWITCH INSIDE THE INDUSTRY AND PULLED THE TRAIN BYTO REMOVE EOT AND SHOVE INTO #1 TRACK TO SPOT TRAIN. THE W54220 CONDUCTOR REMOVED EOT BUT FAILED TOLINE MOVEMENT FOR #1 INDUSTRY TRACK. THE W54220 CONDUCTOR GOT IN THE TAXI THAT WAS CALLED TO BRINGTHE CREW BACK TO WILMINGTON AND WENT TO THE BOTTOM OF #1 TRACK TO SPOT TRAIN. WHILE AT THE BOTTOM OF#1 TRACK THE CONDUCTOR INITIATED THE SHOVE MOVEMENT BUT WAS NOT IN POSITION TO SEE THE MOVEMENT BEGIN AND TRAVERSED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION DUE TO FAILING TO PROPERLY LINE THE #1 SWITCH.  AFTER SHOVING 1017 FEET, THE REAR OF W54220 SHOVED INTO THE SIDE OF Y20021 THAT WAS PULLING SOUTH. THE Y20021 RADIOED FOR THE W54220 TO STOP. THIS RESULTED IN 3 CARS OF THE W54220 DERAILING AND 6 CARS DERAILING ON THE Y20021.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident
