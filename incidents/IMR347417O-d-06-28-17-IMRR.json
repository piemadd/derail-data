MECHANICAL, TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING DEPARTMENTS RESPONDED TO INVESTIGATE.  THEKCS TRAIN, CONSISTING OF 2 LOCOMOTIVES PULLING 2 EMPTY CARS DERAILED AT THE A-YARD LEAD / RIP TRACKLEAD SWITCH ON A FACING POINT MOVE.  THE 1ST AND 2ND AXLES, (ALL 4 WHEELS) LOST CONTACT WITH THE RAIL AT THE SWITCH POINT, AND TRAVERSED APPROXIMATELY 65 FEET AFTER LEAVING THE RAIL, OF WHICH ALL WHEELS OF THE 3RD AND 4TH AXLES REMAINED ON THE RAIL AND TRAVERSED THE SAME SWITCH POINT WITH THE SWITCHLINED FOR THE DIRECTION INTENDED.  INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE R1 WHEEL, MEASURING 7 ON THE FLANGE GAUGE, STRUCK AND CLIMBED THE SWITCH POINT, BREAKING THE SWITCH POINT, CAUSING THE WHEEL TO LEAVE THE RAIL.\r\n\r\nIMRR AND KCS HAVE INVESTIGATED THE DERAILMENT AND DISAGREE REGARDING ITS CAUSE.  IMRRâ€™S INVESTIGATIVE TEAM COMPRISED OF ENGINEERING AND MECHANICAL PERSONNEL THAT DETERMINED THE SWITCH POINT BROKE WHEN STRUCK BY THE R1 WHEEL OF THE KCS LOCOMOTIVE, WHICH MEASURED 7 ON A FLANGE GAUGE.  THE NEARLY CONDEMNABLE LEAD WHEEL AND FLANGE CAUSED THE WHEEL TO RIDE OVER THE BROKEN POINT AND FALLBETWEEN THE STOCK RAIL AND POINT.
