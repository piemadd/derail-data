THEY CHARGED UP THE AUTOMATIC BRAKES, RELEASED THE HANDBRAKES ON THE TRACK OF 40 CARS AND PULLED SOUTH TO CHECK THE ORDER OF THE CARS. AFTER PULLING THE ENTIRE TRACK, THE CONDUCTOR SAW THAT THE REAR CAR, XOMX 710363, WAS NOT NEEDED FOR THEIR TRAIN. HE SHOVED THIS CAR NORTH TO THE CLEARANCE POINT ON ALDEN SIDING AND REQUESTED A FULL SERVICE BRAKE APPLICATION AND 3-STEP PROTECTION.  HE APPLIED THE HANDBRAKE ON THE SINGLE CAR AND INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER TO PUSH AGAINST THE CAR IN ORDER TO TEST THE HANDBRAKE. THIS WAS NECESSARY AS THIS LOCATION IS ON A GRADE AND THE LONE HANDBRAKE WOULD NOT HOLD THE ENTIRE TRAIN OF 40 CARS. CONDUCTOR ALLEGEDLY NOTED THAT THE CAR HANDBRAKE WAS EFFECTIVE, STOPPED THE MOVEMENT AND CUT AWAY THE CAR. HE THEN INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER TO PULL AHEAD TO CLEAR THE CROSS-OVER SWITCH. AS THE ENGINEER BEGAN PULLING AHEAD, THE CONDUCTOR NOTICED THAT THE LONE CAR WAS BEGINNING TO ROLL NORTH DOWN THE GRADE. HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE CAR AS THE HANDBRAKE WAS TIGHT. THE CAR CONTINUED TO ROLL THE LENGTH OF ALDEN SIDING UNTIL IT STRUCK THE NORTH-END DERAIL WHICH CAUSED THE CAR TO DERAIL AND ROLL ON ITS SIDE.","Joint Track Type":"Siding","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"CSX000107076201208","Report Key":"CSX000107076201208","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation"}
