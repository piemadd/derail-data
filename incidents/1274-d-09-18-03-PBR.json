THE PBR ENGINEER ATTEMPTED TOMAKE A BRAKE APPLICATION TO STOP THE TRAIN AS THEY APPROACHED THE NORTH END OF THE NS YARD TO ALLOWTHE CONDUCTOR TO DISMOUNT THE LOCOMOTIVE TO LINE A SWITCH.  THE TRAIN BRAKES WOULD NOT APPLY DUE TOA DEFECTIVE ANGLE COCK ON THE PBR216 LOCOMOTIVE THAT VIBRATED INTO THE CLOSED POSITION DURING THE 6.5 MILE TRIP BETWEEN THE PBR AND THE NS YARD AT BAYVIEW.  THE PBR TRAIN PROCEEDED IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION UNABLE TO STOP AND COLLIDED WITH A STANDING NS TRAIN THAT CONSISTED OF NS LOCOMOTIVES 8424, 6737, 6763, 6724 AND 85 CARS.  THE PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE COLLISION WAS A DEFECTIVE ANGLE COCK ON THEPBR 216 LOCOMOTIVE.  THE ANGEL COCK IS A SIMPLE BALL COCK THAT IS NOT A LOCKING TYPE.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE ANGLE COCK VIBRATED CLOSED DURING THE 6.5 - MILE TRIP FOR THE PBR YARD AT SPARROWS POINTTO THE NS BAYVIEW YARD THIS WOULD COINCIDE WITH THE ENGINEER'S DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENTS PRECEDING THE COLLISION.  IN HIS STATEMENT HE SAYS THAT AFTER THE INITIAL TERMINAL AIR BRAKE TEST WAS COMPLETEDHE APPLIED THE BRAKES WHILE LEAVING \"A\" YARD AT SPARROWS POINT AND THE BRAKES WERE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  HE ALSO CLAIMS THAT HE APPLIED THE BRAKES WHILE TRAVELING THROUGH THE \"WISE AVENUE\" YARD, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 1-MILE INTO THE TRIP, AND THE BRAKES AGAIN FUNCTIONED PROPERLY.
