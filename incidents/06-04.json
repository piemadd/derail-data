THE NIGHT CREW WAS PULLING 105 EMPTY CARS FROM TRACK #5 TO SPOT FOR LOADING.THE 105 CARS HAD BEEN PULLING INTO THAT TRACK EARLIER IN THE SHIFT, AND THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN AND OUT OF THE TRACK WITH THE SAME CARS  PRIOR TO 12:30 AM. ONLY ONE 300 HORSEPOWER LOCOMOTIVE WAS BEING USED TO PULL THE EMPTY CARS OUT.  AFTER THE ENGINEER PULLED OUT ABOUT 20 TO 25 LENGTHS AT NO MORE THAN 6 MPH, HE FELT A BIG JOLT FOLLOW BY ANOTHER.  THE TRAIN THEN CAME TO A STOP.  THE63RD CAR IN THE CONSIST HIT THE CROSSOVER SWITCH ON TRACK #5 AND CAUSED IT TO LINE ITSELF.  THE SWITCH PONT WAS GAPPED AND THE SWITCH WAS PUMPING UP AND DOWN WHEN THE CARS WENT OVER IT.  THE FIRST WHEEL FROM THE SECOND TRUCK SET ON CAR MP 641648 HIT THE GAP ON THE SWITCH-POINT AT THE EXACT MOMENT THAT THE SWITCH WAS PUMPING UP AND DOWN.  THIS CAUSED THE DERAILMENT  OF THE REAR TRUCK SET ON MP 641648.  THE FRONT TRUCK SET STAYED ON TRACK #5 WHILE THE REAR TRUCK SET TRAVELING INTO THE CROSSOVER TO#4 TRACK.  WHEN MP 541648 REACHED THE SECOND CROSSOVER SWITCH ON TRACK #4 IT RAN THROUGH THE SWITCHAND CAUSED THE FOLLOWING TWO CARS (MP 641465 & GVSR 90292) TO DERAIL.  AT THIS POINT THERE WERE 62CARS ON TRACK #5 AND THE REMAINING 43 CARS WERE IN THE CROSSOVER TO TRACK #4.  GVSR 90292 CONTINUEDTO MOVE ON TRACK #4 UNTIL IT HIT HZGX 3863 THAT WAS STATIONARY ON THAT TRACK.
