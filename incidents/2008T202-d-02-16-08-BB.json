THE CSX TRAIN CREW WAS SETTING OUT CARS IN THE BANK TRACK AND PICKING UP CARS IN THE #4 TRACK.  ALL SWITCHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED FROM THE SOUTH END OF THE YARD, WHICH IS ALSO IN AN INTERLOCKING PLANT CONTROLLED BY THE CSX CQ DISPATCHER.  THE CREW CONDUCTED THE INITIAL SHOVING MOVE FROM THE RF&P SUB #3 TRACKINTO THE BB #4 TRACK.  THE CONDUCTOR LINED THE SOUTH CROSSOVER SWITCH AND HAD THE ENGINEER MOVE THEINBOUND CUT OF CARS INTO THE BANK TRACK.  AFTER THE CUT WAS PLACED AND SECURED, THE CONDUCTOR HAD THE ENGINEER MOVE SOUTH.  THE HEAD END OF THE TRAIN WAS IN THE INTERLOCKING PLANT; THE ENGINEER CONTACTED THE CQ DISPATCHER TO OBTAIN AUTHORIZATION TO MOVE NORTH INTO THE #4 TRACK ONCE AGAIN.  THE ENGINEER CHECKED WITH THE CONDUCTOR (AFTER RECEIVING AUTHORIZATION); THE CONDUCTOR TOLD THE ENGINEER THAT ALL SWITCHES WERE LINED FOR THE MOVEMENT INTO THE #4 TRACK FOR THE PICKUP.  DURING THIS TIME ONE OF THE SWITCHES WAS NOT CORRECTLY LINED FOR THE MOVEMENT.  WHEN THE MOVEMENT WAS MADE, THE NORTH SWITCH OF THE CROSSOVER FROM #4 TRACK TO THE BANK TRACK WAS RUN THROUGH.  THE TRAIN WAS COUPLED TO THE OUTBOUND CUT OF CARS, THE EOT HUNG, AND BRAKE TEST COMPLETED.  THE HEAD END OF THE TRAIN WAS STILL FOULING THE RF&P MAIN TRACK (TRACK #3); THE ENGINEER BACKED THE TRAIN NORTH APPROXIMATELY 150` TO CLEAR.
