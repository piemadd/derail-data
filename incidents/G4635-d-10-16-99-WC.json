THE CONDUCTOR THOUGHT THE CAR MADE A JOINT AND WAS STOPPED.  HE THEN STATED, OVERTHE RADIO, THAT TRACK WAS CLEAR OF 39 TRACK AND CAR DOWX 21223 WAS KICKED TO 38 TRACK.  THE CONDUCTOR THEN WALKED OVER TO 39 TRACK TO INSURE THAT THE JOINT WAS IN FACT MADE AND AS HE APPROACHED THE CAR IT BEGAN TO ROLL EAST.  HE APPLIED THE HAND BRAKE ON GACX 73229 BUT IT DIDN'T STOP IN THE CLEAR AND THERE WASN'T ENOUGH TIME FOR HIM TO REACH THE 38 SWITCH BEFORE THE CAR WENT OVER IT INTO 38 TRACKSIDESWIPING DOWX 21223.  INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE CONDUCTOR FAILED TO PROPERLY SECURE THE HAND BRAKE ON THE GACX 73229 BEFORE KICKING ANOTHER CAR INTO ANOTHER TRACK.
