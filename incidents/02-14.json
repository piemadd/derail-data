FOREMANWAS IN CONTROL OF THE MOVEMENT ON THE HEADEND ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE LOCOMOTIVE MOVING SOUTH AND SWITCHMAN WAS RIDING THE REAR CAR OF THE CUT. FOREMAN BEGAN TO SLOW THE MOVEMENT DOWN AS THEY WERE COMING UP TO THE 910 SWITCH. HE MADE THE NOTCHES OF ACCELERATION FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVE AND THENDECELERATING CORRECTLY BY NOTCHING FROM 10 TO 7 TO 4 TO COAST, TO STOP. THE DOWNLOAD CONFIRMS THISTHAT HE CONTROLLED THE MOVEMENT CORRECTLY AND THERE WAS NO TIR'S ON ANY LOCOMOTIVES THAT WOULD HAVEBEEN POINTED IN THAT DIRECTION. AT THE TIME OF THE IMPACT THE YSA30R-15 WAS TRAVELING AT 4MPH AT WHICH TIME THE SPEED SPIKED UP TO 14MPH. ALL THE CARS WERE BLED OFF BY THE CAR DEPARTMENT WHEN THEY DIDTHE INBOUND INSPECTIONS EARLIER IN THE DAY. THE TRACK AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION HAD A TOTAL OF166 CARS FROM THE INBOUND MMCSAS-09 AND THIS WAS THE 3RD CUT THAT WE TOOK OFF THE SOUTH END TO SWITCH. SOMEHOW THE UP218240 CAME UNCOUPLED FROM THE CMO15242 AND THAT CAUSED THE REAR 19 CARS OF THE CUTTO RUN INTO HEAD 7 CARS THAT WERE STILL CONNECTED TO THE RCL SET. AS WE INSPECTED THE CARS FROM THEDERAILMENT THERE WERE NO HAND BRAKES ON ANY OF THE CARS (WHICH THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN) AND ALLTHE CARS WERE COUPLED UP AT THAT POINT, BUT THE TRAIN LINE HOSE WAS UNCOUPLED BETWEEN THE UP218240 AND CMO15242 WHICH ALSO PROVES THAT THE CARS CAME UNCOUPLED.

ONCE THEY CUT AWAY, THEY PULLED TO THE NORTH END OF THE TRACK TO WAIT FOR THE IBPG4 13 TO CLEAR IN TO TRACK 404 AND THE ILXG4X 09 TO CLEAR INTO TRACK 316. ONCE CLEAR, UTILITY 2 LINED THE NORTH 300 SWITCH FOR THE 400 TRACKS. THE UTILITY JOB DID NOT NOTIFY JOB 2. THEN, JOB 2 CONDUCTOR GOT THE LINE-UP FOR THEIR MOVE TO COME OUT OF TRACK 406, CROSSOVER INTO 210; CROSSOVER AGAIN INTO TRACK 213 AND CLEAR PASTTHE NORTH 212 SWITCH. HOWEVER, THE JOB 2 CONDUCTOR LINED THE 300 SWITCH AGAINST HIS MOVEMENT AND FAILED TO VERIFY THAT THE SWITCH WAS LINED FOR THEIR MOVE. NOT REALIZING THE 300 SWITCH WAS IMPROPERLYLINED, THE CONDUCTOR IMPROPERLY PROTECTED THE MOVE THROUGH THE CROSSOVERS, PAST THE NORTH 212 SWITCH. THIS RESULTED IN THE 300 SWITCH BEING RUN THROUGH. JOB 2 THEN WYED THEIR POWER (VIA 212-210) ANDWENT INTO TRACK 811 FROM THE NORTH END. SHORTLY AFTER JOB 2 WAS IN TRACK 811, JOB 1 BROUGHT THE KG4LB 12 POWER (8100*8749*5164*7802*4886) OUT OF THE 600'S AND INTO TRACK 210, PAST THE 62 CROSSOVERS. ONCE CLEAR OF THE CROSSOVERS, THE CONDUCTOR LINED THE MOVE INTO THE 300'S VIA THE 62 CROSSOVERS. THECONDUCTOR FAILED TO  VERIFY THE 300 SWITCH TO ENSURE THAT THE SWITCH POINT WAS FLUSH AGAINST THE RAIL. WHEN THE LOCOMOTIVES ROLLED OVER THE RUN THROUGH SWITCH, THEY STARTED TO DERAIL.
