WHILE TRAVERSING THAT LEG OF THE WYE, ONE WHEEL OF A CAR DERAILED AND WAS DRAGGED ABOUT 1,100 FEET WHERE IT RERAILED ITSELF AT THE HEALBLOCK OF THE SOUTH WYE SWITCH. AN INSPECTION DETERMINED: (1) THAT THE TRACK WAS WITHIN CLASS 1 STANDARDS. (2) THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE AT THE SITE THAT THERE WAS A HIGH FLANGE ON ONE CAR, AND THE WAY THE WHEEL CLIMBED THE RAIL WOULD INDICATE A SLIGHTLY STIFF TRUCK (TRAIN WAS INTERCHANGED TO THE UP BEFORE THE DERAILMENT WAS DISCOVERED. UP WAS INFORMED AND STATED THE CARS HAD LEFT THE INTERCHANGE BUTHAD BEEN INSPECTED AND NO DEFECT NOTED. FOR THIS REASON, WE COULD NOT DETERMINE WHICH CAR DERAILEDAND GET A MEASUREMENT OFF THAT CAR). (3) THE DOWNLOAD SHOWED THAT THE TRAIN MAINTAINED A STEADY FIVEMILE PER HOUR PULL THROUGH THE DERAILMENT LOCATION. BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE DERAILMENT WAS CAUSED WHEN A HIGH FLANGE CAUGHT A JOINT BAR AND STARTED TO CLIMB THE RAIL, THIS COMBINED WITH THE SLIGHT PROFILE AND GAUGE NARROWED BY THE ROLLOVER ALLOWED THE WHEEL TO CLIMB THE RAIL AND DERAIL. L/V (LATERAL OVER VERTICLE). THE DERAILMENT WAS NOT DISCOVERED UNTIL THE NEXT TRAIN CREW REPORTED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL BROKEN TIES IN THAT AREA AT ABOUT 2100 ON JULY 29, 2019.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"KYLEKYL126119D201907","Report Key":"KYLEKYL126119D201907","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"KYLE","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Kyle Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Genesee & Wyoming","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"KYLE","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Kyle Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Genesee & Wyoming"}
