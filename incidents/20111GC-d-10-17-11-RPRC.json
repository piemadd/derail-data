THE TRAIN WAS OPERATING  WITH THE LOCOMOTIVE PULLING  THE 24 CARS GEOGRAPHICALLY NORTH THROUGH THE SOUTH END OF LRTC'S PARR YARD FACILITY (TRACK 122). AT THE GRADE CROSSING FOR LRTC FACILITY (DOT# 931046R), THE CREW OBSERVED A TRUCK CROSSING AHEAD OF THEM, AT WHICH TIME THEY SOUNDED THEHORN AND BELL. THE TRUCK CLEARED THE CROSSING AND THEN PROCEEDED TO MAKE A FAST U-TURN AND CAME BACKTOWARD THE CROSSING. THE CREW AGAIN SOUNDED THE HORN FREQUENTLY, BUT THE TRUCK CONTINUED ONTO THE CROSSING. THE ENGINEER PLACED THE TRAIN INTO EMERGENCY ( ALL CARS HAD THEIR BRAKES HOOKED UP AND OPERATING), BUT WAS UNABLE TO STOP BEFORE STRIKING THE TRUCK. THE TRUCK WAS STILL MOVING ACROSS  THE GRADE CROSSING AT TIME OF IMPACT. ACCORDING TO CREW STATEMENTS THE TRUCK DRIVER NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED THEHORN AND BELL SIGNALS  FROM THE TRAIN, OR THE PRESENCE OF THE TRAIN ITSELF AT ANY POINT. HE WAS ALSOOBSERVED TO BE WEARING A \"BLUETOOTH\" PHONE DEVICE IN HIS RIGHT EAR AT TIME OF IMPACT. THE TRAIN PUSHED THE TRACTOR APPROX. 35 FEET BEFORE STOPPING.
