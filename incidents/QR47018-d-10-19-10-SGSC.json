THE CREW SUCCESSFULLY PULLED 21 CARS FROM TRACK 8 AND DOUBLED OVER TO TRACK 12 TO PULL THE REMAINING CARS. AFTER COUPLING AND CHARGINGTHE AIR SYSTEM THE LOCOMOTIVES (GMTX 2000 & 2002) WERE UNABLE TO PULL THE ENTIRE STRING OF 44 LOADED CARS. THE DECISION WAS MADE TO MAKE A CUT AT CAR 26, PULL THESE CARS, WITH THE INTENTION OF RETURNING LATER TO PULL THE REMAINING 18 CARS. THE BRAKEMAN MOUNTED THE \"B\" END OF CAR 27 AND SET A HAND BRAKE. HE THEN WALKED BACK TO THE \"A\" END AND MISTAKENLY CLOSED THE ANGLE COCK ON CAR 27 (BOTTLING THE AIR). THE BRAKEMAN THEN REQUESTED A BUMP OF THE STRING TO ALLOW THE RELEASE OF THE COUPLER PIN, THE CARS WERE BUMPED, THE PIN WAS RELEASED AND THE TRAIN PULLED AWAY. WHEN THE AIR HOSES SEPARATED THETRAIN LOST AIR PRESSURE AND THE BRAKES WERE PUT INTO EMERGENCY APPLICATION. AT THAT POINT THE BRAKEMAN REALIZED THAT HE HAD CLOSED THE WRONG ANGLE COCK AND OBSERVED THE STRING OF CARS THAT WERE NOT ATTACHED TO THE LOCOMOTIVE ROLLING AWAY. THE GRADE OF TRACK 12 IS APPROXIMATELY 4%, THE CARS ACCELERATED QUICKLY AND THE BRAKEMAN WAS UNABLE TO CATCH THEM. THE 18 CARS ROLLED THROUGH A CLOSED CHAIN LINK FENCE GATE CONTINUED TO ROLL AND IMPACTED AN EARTHEN BERM, CHVX 890297 PASSED COMPLETELY THROUGH THE BERM WITH ALL 4 AXLES DERAILING, THE TRAILING CAR CHVX 889466 ALSO DERAILED ONE AXLE SET.
