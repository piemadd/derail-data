WHILE TRAVERSING THRU THE SIDING M806 WENT UNDERNEATH THE OLD SHANNON LOAD OUT AS EVERY OTHER TRAIN DOES WHEN TRAVERSING THRU THE SIDING. AS M803 APPROACHD THE LOAD OUT, THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE SWITCH UNDERNEATH THE LOAD OUT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS LINED FOR THE SIDINGAND NOT THE SPUR TRACK. THE CREW DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING ABOVE THAT WOULD HINDER THEIR MOVEMENT. THEY PULLED TO THE NORTH END OF SHANNON AND STOPPED TO WAIT FOR M80423. DISPATCHER WAS NOTIFIED BY A PEDESTRIAN AROUND THE AREA THAT THE M80323 HAD STRUCK THE LOAD OUT. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WASFOUND AND DETERMINED THAT THE DUMPER / SHOOT WAS LOWER THAN NORMAL AND ENGINE WAMX 4117 HAD STRUCKTHE LOAD OUT WITH THE HORNS ON THE TOP OF THE LOCOMOTIVE. THIS CAUSED THE SHOOT TO SHIFT OR DROP FURTHER. KCSM 19330 WAS THE NEXT CAR TO COME THRU AND HIT THE DUMPER / SHOOT.
