AFTER THE MOVE WAS MADE TO THE SOUTH ELEVATOR TRACK SWITCH, THE CONDUCTOR LINED THE SWITCH AND WALKED BACK TOWARDS THE FIRST LOAD IN ORDER TO MAKE THE JOINT. IN DOING SO, THE CONDUCTOR FAILED TO REMOVE THE DERAIL. THE FIRST EMPTY IN THE SHOVE CLIMBED THE DERAIL HOWEVER IT DID NOT DERAIL ANY WHEELS AND THE CONDUCTOR STILL FAILED TO NOTICE THE DERAIL WAS STILL ON. THE CONDUCTOR MADE THE JOINT AND THEN WALKED BACK FURTHER TO MAKE ANOTHER JOINT THUS CAUSING TWO ADDITIONAL EMPTIES TO CLIMB THE DERAIL BUT NOT DERAIL. ONCE THE CARS WERE ALL COUPLED AND HAND BRAKES WERE RELEASED, HE TOLD THE ENGINEER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PULL. AS THIS MOVE WAS MADE THE DERAIL NOW FUNCTIONED AS REQUIRED AND DERAILED THE 3 EMPTIES AND TWO ADDITIONAL LOADS. A TOTAL OF FIVE CARS WERE DERAILED WITH THREE OF THEM ON THEIR SIDES.\r\n\r\nUPON INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT THE CONDUCTOR ADMITTED THAT HE HAD FAILED TO REMOVE THE DERAIL AND ACTUALLY REMOVED THE DERAIL AFTER THE DERAILMENT SO AS TO MAKE IT APPEAR THAT HE HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN IT OFF.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"IANRSRD0307142201403","Report Key":"IANRSRD0307142201403","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 - Commuter West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"IANR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Iowa Northern Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 - Commuter West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"IANR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Iowa Northern Railway Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
