ONCE THE CREW DOUBLED THE TWO TRACKS TOGETHER, THE ENTIRE CUT WAS PULLED OUT (73 CARS), WITH THE REAR 14 CARS BEING PLACED ONTO THE W06 LEAD, WHICH WAS TO BE USED LATER AS HEAD ROOM. AFTERKICKING THE BAD ORDER INTO Y09, THE CONDUCTOR STATED HE TIED BACK ONTO THE 14 CARS ON THE LEAD, STRETCHED THE SLACK AND SHOVED BACK ONE CAR LENGTH. HE THEN STOPPED THE MOVEMENT AND DROVE TO THE REAR END OF THE TRACK TO PROTECT HIS SHOVE. ONCE AT THE REAR, THE CONDUCTOR ADVISED HE STARTED THE SHOVE WITH A CAR COUNT OF 50. DURING THIS SHOVE, A NEARBY YARD JOB (Y12202) CONTACTED THE Y102 VIA RADIO AND ASKED WHICH TRACK THEY WERE SHOVING INTO. THE Y102 ADVISED W06 (?6 IN THE WOODS?), TO WHICH THE Y122 TOLD THEM IT APPEARED THEY WERE SHOVING BACK INTO THE EMPTY HOLE.
