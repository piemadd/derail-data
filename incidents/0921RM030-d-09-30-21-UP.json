THE YGJ63-30 WAS SWITCHING ON AIR; PULLING 38 CARS OUT OF BOWL 1; THE CARS IN BOWL 1 WERE SET OUT BY THE MNYGJ AT 0300 ON 09/30.  THE FOREMAN STOPPED THE MOVEMENT WHEN HE HEARD FLAT SPOTS GOING ALONG THE RAIL.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE UP39755, ALL 4 WHEELS ON THE A END SIDE HAD OVER 1/4 OF TREADBUILD-UP ALONG EACH WHEEL THAT CAUSED UNSAFE MOVMENT ALONG THE RAIL.  THE POD WAS AFTER THE BOWL 1/BOWL 2 FROG, THE CAR TRAVELED AN ESTIMATED 65 FEET BEFORE THE ENGINEER PLACED THE TRAIN INTO EMERGENCY.  INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE EXCESSIVE TREAD BUILD-UP CAUSED THE CAR TO JUMP OFF THE FROG,DERAIL, RE-RAIL, AND THEN DERAIL AGAIN BEFORE THE MOVEMENT WAS STOPPED.  IT WAS SUSPECTED BY MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT THAT A DEFECT ON THE A END OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM CAUSED THE WHEELS TO NOT RELEASE WHICH CREATED THE TREAD BUILD-UP ON THE WHEEL WHLE ENROUTE TO GRAND JUNCTION.  THERE IS DISCOLORATION ONTHE B END WHEELS BUT NO BUILD-UP.  PISTON TRAVEL WAS 6 INCHES, NO HANDBRAKE APPLIED ON THE CAR.  NODEFECT/HOT WHEEL ALERTS FOUND ON THE MNYGJ WHILE ENROUTE TO GRAND JUNCTION.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0921RM030202109","Report Key":"UP0921RM030202109","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
