IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT A \"HOT ZONE\" EXISTS 200 FEETFROM THE CLEARANCE POINT ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE TRACKS IN THE CLASSIFICATION YARD.  NO CAR SHOULD BEHUMPED INTO THIS HOT ZONE WHEN IT IS OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER CAR.  IT WAS NOTED THAT FOR AN ALARM MESSAGE TO BE SENT BY PRO YARDS, CARS MUST BE STATIONARY IN THIS HOT ZONE.
