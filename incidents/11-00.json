THE HOUSETOP LOOSENED AND WAS PULLED FREE.  THE HOUSETOP WAS FOUND 10 FEET WEST OF THE SWITCH.  THE POINT OF DERAILMENT WAS ON THE CURVED STOCK RAIL OF 9W SWITCHAT THE #3 ROD.  THE WHEELS DERAILED TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE RAIL ON THE INSIDE OF THE TURNOUT.  THEFIRST AXLE WENT ON THE GROUND APPROXIMATELY 11' 2\"FROM THE POINT OF DERAILMENT.  THE SECOND AXLE WENT ON THE GROUND 28' 6\" FROM THE POINT OF DERAILMENT.  THE WHEELS RODE OVER A SIGNAL TRIPPER ASSEMBLY, AND THE CAR IMPACTED A SIGNAL POLE AND THE CONCRETE GIRDER OF THE KINNEY STREET BRIDGE.  THE CARCAME TO A STOP 250 FEET BEYOND THE POINT OF DERAILMENT. THE TOTAL DAMAGE TO SIGNAL TRACK AND EQUIPMENT WAS ESTIMATED AT $192,834.  FULL ACCOUNTING FOR THE INCIDENT REMAINS PENDING THE ENGINEERING REPORT.  PRELIMINARY DOLLARS REFLECT REPLACEMENT COST.
