AT MILEPOST207.8, THE TRAIN HAD AN UNDESIRED EMERGENCY STOP.  TWO CARS (20 AND 21 FROM THE HEAD END) WERE DERAILED.  THE FIRST CAR, VAPX 91175, HAD R/L 1-2 OFF THE RAIL; THE SECOND CAR, VAPX 98104, HAD R/L 3-4 OFF THE RAIL.  THE FIRST DERAILED TRUCK STOPPED WITHIN 3 FEET OF THE ENTRY TO A BRIDGE.  THE POINT OFDERAILMENT WAS AT MILEPOST 202.5.  THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF POSSIBLE DRAGGING EQUIPMENT NEAR THIS LOCATION.  BOTH DERAILED CARS HAD ABOUT 10 TO 15% OF THE COAL LOAD IN THE BASE AND ALONG THE ONE SIDE WALL.  THIS AMOUNT OF LOAD LIKELY CAUSED SOME HARMONIC ROCKING.  THE FIRST DERAILED CAR LIFTED OFF THECENTER PIN.  THE TRUCK WENT INTO THE LEADING TRUCK OF THE SECOND CAR, DERAILING IT.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"2","Incident Key":"BB2007T1201200712","Report Key":"BB2007T1201200712","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"BB","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Buckingham Branch Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"Class 1","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Other Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"BB","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Buckingham Branch Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
