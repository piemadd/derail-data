AFTER DOING SO THE UTILITY EMPLOYEE VISUALLY CHECKED THE CARSAGAIN ON TRACK #20 TO ENSURE THEY WERE NOT MOVING AND THEN LOOKED INTO HIS PAPERWORK TO SEE WHAT THE NEXT MOVE WAS TO BE.  SHORTLY AFTER LOOKING THROUGH HIS PAPERWORK, THE CONDUCTOR INSTRUCTED THE UTILITY TO WALK TO TRACK #16 FOR THE HITCH.  AFTER LOOKING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (CARS VISUALLY DETERMINED TO BE SECURED) THE UTILITY PROCEEDED TO THE SPOT TO COUPLE IN TRACK #16.  THE CREW KICKED ONE CARINTO TRACK #16, PULLED BACK OUT OF THE TRACK AND THE CONDUCTOR LINED THE #16 SWITCH FOR THE LADDER THAT WAS LINED ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO TRACK #26.  ONCE HE KICKED THIS CAR TO #26 WHILE IT WAS IN MOTION THE TWO CARS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY KICKED INTO TRACK #20 HAD ROLLED OUT AND STRUCK THE CAR GOING TO#26 ON THE FROG OF THE #20 SWITCH.  THE CREW THEN NOTIFIED THE YARDMASTER OF THE INCIDENT WHO CONTACTED THE TRAINMASTER.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"CSX000151486201508","Report Key":"CSX000151486201508","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 -
