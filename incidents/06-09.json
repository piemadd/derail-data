WHILE SHOVING A CUT OF 28 LOADED TANK CARS CONTAINING FUEL (AVIATION, FUEL, TURBINE ENGINE, COMBUSTIBLE LIQUID, UN 1863, PG III), ANCHORAGE YARD JOB #438, IN A NORTHWARD MOVEMENT, STRUCK A TANK CAR CONTAINING A RESIDUE OF THE SAME MATERIAL. THE TANK CAR THEY STRUCK ON TRACK B HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE FOUL OF THE B/C TRACK SWITCH. NO INJURIES, FIRE OR LEAKAGE RESULTED FROM THIS INCIDENT. THE CREW HAD SHOVED A CUT OF 83 CARS NORTHWARD INTO THE FLINT HILLS LOOP. THE CONDUCTOR AND BRAKEMAN RODE THE POINT OF THE MOVEMENT TO THE A/B TRACKS SWITCH WHERE THE BRAKEMANDROPPED OFF AND THE CONDUCTOR CONTINUED RIDING THE POINT OF THE CARS AROUND THE LOOP ON TRACK A. THECONDUCTOR STOPPED THE MOVE WITH THE LEADING CAR AT THE END OF THE LOADING RACK. HE THEN SECURED ANDCUT OFF NINE CARS. AFTER CLEARING THE CONSTRUCTION CROSSING, THE CONDUCTOR SECURED THE CARS AND WALKED TOWARD THE A/B CROSSOVER TO PROTECT A SHOVING MOVEMENT ON TRACK C.  MEANWHILE, THE BRAKEMAN LINED THE B/C SWITCH FOR MOVEMENT INTO TRACK C, WHILE A CAR ON B TRACK FOULED THE B/C SWITCH. THE BRAKEMAN MADE  A CUT ON TRACK A, CLEAR OF THE A/B TRACK SWITCH AND THE ENGINE PULLED A CUT OF 28 CARS SOUTHWARD TO CLEAR THE SAME SWITCH.  THE BRAKEMAN THEN LINED THE SWITCH FOR MOVEMENT INTO TRACK B AND INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER TO SHOVE NORTHWARD 15 CARS LENGTHS.
