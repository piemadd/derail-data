AFTER DOUBLING THE TRAIN, THE CREW COMPLETED THE REQUIRED AIR TEST AND SHOVED OUT OF TRACK 741 NORTH ON THE KAISER LEAD SO THEY COULD DEPART SOUTH TO COLTON.  WHILE SHOVING ONTO THE KAISER LEAD, CARS 12 THROUGH 16 FROM THE HEAD END DERAILED.  CUSTOMER INSTRUCTED CREW TO PULL ALL CARS INCLUDING LINES 14 (PTTX153255) AND LINE 15 (PTTX602349) WHICH WERE NOT RELEASED FROM THE CUSTOMER, BOTH ARE EMPTY FLATS.  WHILE SHOVING THROUGH THE CURVE, EQUIPPED WITH MULTIPLE GAUGE RODS, THE LATERAL FORCE OF THE PTTX602349 (B END) CAUSED THE FLANGE OF THE WHEELS TO CLIMB OFF THE WEST RAIL.  THE MOVE CONTINUED FOR A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 1200 FEET FROM THE POINT OF DERAILMENT.  CSI PLACED THE TWO EMPTY FLAT CARS INTO TRACK 745 BETWEEN 17 LOADS OF STEEL.

AS THE CONSIST APPROACHED THE BUMPING BLOCK ON TRACK 7, THE EVENT RECORDER ON OPERATING CAR 5673 REVEALED THAT THE TRAIN WAS MOVING AT 17 MPHON A TRACK RESTRICTED TO 8 MPH.  THE EVENT RECORDER INDICATED THAT HE PLACED THE TRAIN INTO A \"FULLSERVICE BRAKE\"  AT 09:01:30.1 HOURS WHILE TRAVELING AT 17 MPH.  AT 09:01:31.9, THE TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY BRAKE TRAVELING AT 11 MPH.  LEAD CAR 5763 STRUCK THE BUMPING BLOCK AT 11 MPH.  THE FORCE OFTHE IMPACT CAUSED THE LEAD CAR TO CLIMB OVER THE BUMPING.   THE CAR ALSO STRUCK NEW AUTOMATIC TRAINCONTROL EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING AN ATC POLE.  THE NO. 1 TRUCK OF LEAD CAR 5673 DERAILED.  THE BUMBINGBLOCK AND ALL ASSOCUATED TRACK COMPONENTS SUSTAINED MAJOR DAMAGE.  \r\n\r\nAN INVESTIGATION AND THE ANALYSIS OF ALL INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED,  IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OFTHIS COLLISION WAS THE FAILURE BY THE ENGINEER TO PROPERLY CONTROL HIS TRAIN.   \r\n\r\nDAMAGE COSTS RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT DAMAGE AND LABOR COSTS WERE:  CED- $21,683.85; W&S- $14,300.00  AUTOMATIC TRAIN CONTROL EQUIPMENT (ATC) 21,243.14.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"No","Class":"No","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"PATHI100114201410","Report Key":"PATHI100114201410","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 -
