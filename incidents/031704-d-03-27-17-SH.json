THE CONDUCTOR WAS ON THE HIND END OF THE DRAG PROTECTING THE MOVEMENT. HE DROPPED AT THE CO20/SAC SWITCH AND USED ACREW RADIO TO HAVE THE ENGINEER CONTINUE SHOVING INTO TRACK CO 20. WHEN THE FIRST CAR DERAILED, HE INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER BY RADIO TO STOP THE MOVEMENT OF THE CONSIST. THE ENGINEER STOPPED WITHIN TWOCAR LENGTHS, USING THE LOCOMOTIVE BRAKE TO STOP THE 43 CAR DRAG. WHILE SHOVING BOTH TRUCKS ON TTPX806554 AND 804363, AND THE WESTERN TRUCK OF TTPX 81099 DERAILED DUE TO WIDE GAGE. THE WIDE GAGE WASLOCATED 20' WEST OF THE CO20/SAC TURNOUT. THE CARS WERE THE 9TH, 10TH AND 11TH CARS IN THE DRAG, WITH 8 LOADED RAILCARS OF SKELP PASSING THE DERAILMENT SITE. THE DERAILMENT CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE SAC TRACK IN TWO LOCATIONS, SHIFTED THE CO20/SAC  TURNOUT DAMAGEING RAIL AND POINT, SHIFTED THE CO21/SAC SWITCH POINT AREA TO HEEL BLOCKS AND DAMAGED CO 20 TRACK FOR SEVERAL FEET. NEW RAIL, TWO SWITCH POINTS, TIES OF DIFFERENT LENGHTS, STONE AND TAMP ENTIRE AREA OF THE DERAILMENT SITE.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SH031704201703","Report Key":"SH031704201703","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"SH","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Steelton & Highspire Railroad","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"SH","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Steelton & Highspire Railroad","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
