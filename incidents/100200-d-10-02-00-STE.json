AFTER PERFORMING AN AIR BRAKE TEST THE ENGINEER STARTED PULLING THE CUT OF CARS, AT THAT POINT 15 OF THE RAILCARS PROCEEDED DOWN ST&E MAIN TRACK AND THE OTHER 8 RAILCARS THAT WERE SHOVED THROUGH THE UP SWITCH PROCEEDED DOWN AN ADJACENT TRACK OWNED BY THE UP RAILROAD, CAUSING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH RAILCARS TO DERAIL, AND THE REMAINING 6 RAILCARS ON THE UP RAILROAD.  ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2000,BNSF INTERCHANGED RAILCARS TO ST&E.  ST&E CREW WERE OFF ON SEPTEMBER 30TH AND OCTOBER 1ST.  CONCLUSION:  BNSF EMPLOYEES EITHER SHOVED WITHOUT A PERSON RIDING THE POINT WHILE SHOVING AROUND THE CURVETO PROTECT THE MOVEMENT, OR THEY FAILED TO REPORT THAT THEY HAD RAN THROUGH A SWITCH OF A FOREIGN RAILROAD.  IN EITHER CASE, IT'S A VIOLATION OF THE BNSF OPERATING RULES.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"STE100200200010","Report Key":"STE100200200010","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"STE","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Stockton Terminal & Eastern Railroad","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Omnitrax","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"STE","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Stockton Terminal & Eastern Railroad","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Omnitrax"}
