THE TRAIN CONSISTED OF 30 CARS, 27 LOAD AND 3 EMPTIES. THE LEADING LOCOMOTIVES AND 18 CARS PASSED THROUGH SAFELY. THE FIRST CAR INVOLVED IN THE DERAILMENT WAS NUMBER 19 (WITH CAR #1 BEING DIRECTLY BEHIND THE LOCOMOTIVES), WITH CARS 20-23 FOLLOWING. CARS 24-30 ALSO REMAINED ON THETRACK. FOLLOWING FRA GUIDELINES, THERE WAS NO REASON TO TEST FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE WE HAD NO REASONABLE SUSPICION AND IT WAS NOT GOING TO MEET THE CRITERIA NECESSARY FOR TESTING. WE BELIEVE THE CAUSE FOR THE DERAILMENT WAS A BROKEN RAIL. IT APPEARS THE INSIDE RAIL OF A LEFT HANDCURVE BROKE ADDING PRESSURE TO THE OUTSIDE RAIL CAUSING IT TO ROLL OVER. CARS 19-21 RODE THE WEB OFTHE OUTSIDE RAIL WHILE THE INSIDE WHEELS DROPPED IN. CAR 22 DRIFTED OUTSIDE OF THE TRACK BED, PULLING CAR 23 OFF WITH IT. THE TRAIN STOPPED BEFORE ANY OTHER CARS WERE INVOLVED. IN THE SUMMER OF 2020,OVER 200 TIES WERE REPLACED IN THIS AREA. ADDITIONALLY, WE INSPECT TRACK WEEKLY, INCLUDING CHECKINGFOR WIDE GAUGE AND OTHER DEFECTS. WE HAD JUST INSPECTED THE TRACK ON 1/22/21 AND 1/25/21. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAD RUN A TRAIN ACROSS THE SAME TRACK THAT MORNING. IF THERE HAD BEEN WIDE GAUGE, OR OTHER NOTICABLE DEFECTS, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SPOTTED AND CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY. DUE TO OUR INVESTIGATION ANDOTHER SUPPORTING INFORMATON, WE BELIEVE THE CAUSE WAS BROKEN RAIL.
