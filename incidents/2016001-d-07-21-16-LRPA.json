I DISAGREE BECAUSE THE CROSSLEVEL VARIATION WAS ONLY 2 3/8 OF AN INCH, WELL WITHIN TRACK TOLERANCES FOR CLASS 1 TRACK AND AN INDUSTRIAL LEAD. HE USED THE ELEVATION OF THE CURVE TO FACTOR THAT THE AREA WAS OUT OF COMPLIANCE DUETO THE DIP AND THE ELEVATION OF THE CURVE COMBINED BEING OVER 3 INCHES, BUT THE AREA WHERE THE CROSSLEVEL WAS LOCATED WAS FARTHER AWAY THAN THE 62 FEET ALLOWED FOR THIS COMPUTATION. FOUR LOCOMOTIVESAND 38 CARS PASSED OVER THE SAME SPOT WITH NO DIFFICULTY. THE FRONT WHEELS OF THE 39TH CAR WERE PULLED OFF THE TRACK WHILE THE TRAILING 5 CARS CROSSED THE SAME SPOT WITH NO ISSUES. THE DERAILED CAR WAS PULLED OVER 1/4 OF A MILE, WHERE DAMAGE TO THE TRACK INDICATES THE TRAIN WAS BECOMING HARDER TO PULL SO THE ENGINEER INCREASED THE THROTTLE. THE FRONT WHEELS WERE TRAVELING ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THETRACK, BUT WITH THE INCREASED THROTTLE, THE REAR WHEELS WERE JERKED OFF THE RAIL ONTO THE NORTH SIDE. THE TRAIN TRAVELED A SHORT DISTANCE WHERE THE REAR WHEELS RERAILED ON THE ASPHALT. APPROXIMATELY 50 YARDS LATER THERE WAS ANOTHER SURGE OF POWER DERAILING THE BACK WHEELS AGAIN. THE TRAIN WAS PULLEDACROSS THE LRPA TRESTLE WITH 4 WHEELS ON THE GROUND SHEARING BOLTS AND BREAKING THE TOE RAILS THATKEPT THE CAR FROM GOING OFF THE TRESTLE. THE TRAIN TRAVELED ONTO THE UP TRACK WHERE IT WAS FINALLY STOPPED AND THE DERAILED CAR WAS DISCOVERED. I PUT CAUSE OF DERAILMENT AS EXCESSIVE HORSEPOWER.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"2","Incident Key":"LRPA2016001201607","Report Key":"LRPA2016001201607","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"LRPA","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Little Rock Port Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"Class 1","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"LRPA","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Little Rock Port Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
