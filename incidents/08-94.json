S24 & S25. S23 IS THE INSIDE TRK, CLOSEST TO THEMAIN LINE & S25 IS THE OUTSIDE TRK, FURTHEST FROM THE MAIN LINE. THE SWITCH CREW WENT INTO S25 WITHA LIGHT ENGINE. S23 HAD SEVERAL EMPTY RAIL CARS THAT HAD BEEN IN STORAGE FOR SEVERAL DAYS. AS SWITCH CREW WAS PULLING OUT RAIL CARS FROM S25, THE CONDUCTOR HEARD A STRANGE NOISE & FELT A STRONG GUSTOF WIND (THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CLOUDY WITH THUNDERSTORMS & A FUNNEL WAS REPORTED IN THE PORT AREA). IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS THE CONDUCTOR, POSITIONED NEAR MIDDLE OF TRK S25, HEARD A LOUD NOISE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A COLLISION & RADIOED THE ENGINEER TO STOP. AFTER INVESTIGATING THE TRAIN, CONDUCTORFOUND RAIL CARS THAT HAD BEEN STORED ON S23 HAD ROLLED INDEPENDENTLY ONTO RAIL CARS THE CREW WAS PULLING OUT OF S25. CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS UNDETERMINABLE. WE BELIEVE A STRONG WIND OR FUNNEL BLEWTHE EMPTY RAIL CARS ONTO THE RAIL CARS BEING PULLED OUT OF TRK S25.

THE CONDUCTOR INSPECTED THE TRAIN AND FOUND THAT THEREAR MATERIAL HANDLING CAR HAD DERAILED THE REAR TRUCK AND IMPACTED A BRIDGE ABUTMENT ADJACENT TO TRACK #4. THE ENGINEER HAD MADE A RUNNING TEST APPROX 1 MIN. PRIOR TO THE RUN IN AND TRAIN SPEED WASAPPROX 10 MPH. INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DETERMINE A CAUSE AT THIS TIME. IT IS KNOWN THAT THE DERAILED CAR TRAVELED APPROX 650 FT. FROM THE POINT OF DERAILMENT BEFORE STRIKING THE CONCRETE ABUTMENT.
