ROOT CAUSE OF THE L/V DERAILMENT IS THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT THE LLM31R-05 HAD TO SHOVE AGAINST WITH A LIGHT CAR STOPPED ON THE FROG OF A 9.5 DEGREE TURNOUT. THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAVY CAR(138 TONS) CAUSED THE #3 WHEEL ON THE TRAIL ENDING TO RISE ABOVE THE FROGS GUARD RAIL AND GET BEHIND THE POINT OF THE FROG.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP1219GC004201912","Report Key":"UP1219GC004201912","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
