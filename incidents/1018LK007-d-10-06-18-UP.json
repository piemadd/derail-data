PREVIOUSLY IN THE TRIP, THE CREW EXPERIENCED A DYNAMITER IN THE TRAIN, SO WHILE ENTERING THE YARD AND NAVIGATING THE 5 MPH WYE, THE ENGR USED THE INDEPENDENT BRAKE TO CONTROL THE TRAIN/AVOID AN EMERGENCY APPLICATION.  WHILE APPROACHING SWITCHES TO BE LINED FOR THEIR ROUTE, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE 11,319 TRAILING TONS NOT YET THROUGH THE 5 MPH WYE, THE ENGINEER BEGINS TO APPLY THE INDEPENDENT BRAKE WITH HIS 3 UNIT CONSIST.  HE BEGINS TO GATHER SLACK WITH MODERATE APPLICATION, RISING TO 24PSI OF THE AVAILABLE 72PSI OVER 18 SECONDS, BUT THEN THE ENGR APPLIES FULL INDEPENDENT BRAKE OVER THE COURSE OF 8 SECONDS WHILE TRAVELING AT 4 MPH.  ACCORDING TO THE DOWNLOAD AND MEASUREMENTS TAKEN IN THE FIELD, ITIS AT THIS POINT WHERE THE IMMENSE STOPPING FORCE OF THE 3 LOCO CONSIST PUSHES BACK ON THE CONSIDERABLE TONNAGE COMING THROUGH THE WYE.  AS THOSE FORCES MET IN THE CURVE, IT CAUSED A CAR TO LIFT ONTOTHE RAIL.  AFTER THE SWITCHES WERE LINED FOR THEIR ROUTE, THE CREW (STILL UNAWARE) PULLED AHEAD INTOTHEIR RECEIVING TRACK, PULLED THE DERAILED CAR OFF THE BALL OF THE RAIL AND DOWN ONTO THE GROUND WHERE IT CONTINUED TO DRAG AND AFFECT THE CARS BEHIND IT UNTIL THE TRAIN WAS PLACED INTO TRAINLINE EMERGENCY AS CARS BEGAN TO ROLL OVER AND COME APART.
