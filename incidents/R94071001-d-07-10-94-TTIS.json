TAYLOR LINED THE SOUTH LADDER TRACK FOR HIS INTENDED MOVEMENT. HE MADE 3 DOUBLE OVERSON THE NORTH END AND THEN DIRECTED HIS ENGINEER TO SHOVE BACK HIS 62 CAR TRAIN IN THE CLEAR ON THE NORTH END. HE DIRECTED THIS MOVEMENT FROM THE HEAD END, THINKING THAT HIS ALIGNMENT ON THE SOUTH ENDWAS STILL CORRECT. DISPATCHER R.V. DOWLER GAVE A CSX CREW PERMISSION TO PULL EMPTY CARS OUT OF THE #4 TRACK FROM THE SOUTH END, WITHIN THIS SAME TIME FRAME, AND HE DID NOT ADVISE R.L. TAYLOR OF THIS SINCE THEY CAME IN FROM THE SOUTH END, COMPLETED THEIR WORK, AND REPORTED CLEAR OF THE YARD, WHILE R.L. TAYLOR WAS STILL MAKING UP HIS TRAIN AND WAS NOT READY TO SHOVE BACK. THE #4 TRACK SWITCH WAS LEFT IMPROPERLY LINED FOR R.L. TAYLOR'S MOVEMENT AND THE SWITCH WAS RUN THROUGH. ABOUT ONE AND ONE-HALFHOURS LATER, WHEN ANOTHER TRAIN CREW PROCEEDED NORTH WITH THE TRAIN, THE SPLIT SWITCH CAUSED THIS DERAILMENT TO OCCUR.NoneNoneNoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"TTISR94071001199407","Report Key":"TTISR94071001199407","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation"}
