THE YDMSTR REPORTED THE 6TH CAR WAS DERAILED IN A6-CAR CUT OF EMPTY SUB LADLE HEADING NORTH FROM THE MAIN PLANT. \r\nWHILE PULLING NORTHBOUND FROM GREAT LAKES WORKS TOWARDS ZUG ISLAND RCO JOB B20808 PULLING 6 SUB LADLES DERAILED ON TANGENT TRACK. THESIXTH (REAR) CAR IN THE CONSIST, SUB LADLE #29, DERAILED 975’ SOUTH OF BALLINGER CROSSING, AFTER TRAVELING 5,213’ THE CAR CAME TO REST NORTH OF THE PIPELINE SWITCH ON ZUG ISLAND. UPON INVESTIGATION OFTHE TRACK NOTES, EQUIPMENT INSPECTION, RCO STATEMENTS, AND LOCOMOTIVE DOWNLOADS THE TAPS TEAM CONCLUDED THE FOLLOWING:\r\nTHE R4 WHEEL CLIMBED THE RAIL AT THE POINT OF DERAILMENT. THE FLANGE RODE THE TOP OF THE RAIL FOR 78” BEFORE DROPPING TO THE FIELD SIDE OF THE HOT METAL LEAD. THE L4 WHEEL DROPPEDINTO THE GAGE IN CORRESPONDENCE. THE RESULTS OF OUR SITE INSPECTION COMBINED WITH INSPECTION OF THESUB LADLE #29 REVEALED EVIDENCE OF AN IMPROPERLY LOADED CAR. THE CAR WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SOLIDIFIED IRON POOLED TO THE WEST SIDE OF THE CAR RESULTING IMPROPER CLEARANCE OF THE SIDE BEARINGS. THE BEARINGS ON THE WEST ARE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WHILE THE BEARINGS ON THE EAST HAVE CLEARANCE MEASUREMENTS THAT EXCEED THE ALLOWABLE LIMITS BY 1.5”. THIS CONDITION PREVENTED THE CAR FROM ARTICULATING WHILE IN MOTION AND ALLOWING THE R4 WHEEL TO CLIMB THE RAIL.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"DC06201904","Report Key":"DC06201904","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"DC","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Delray Connecting Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Transtar","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"DC","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Delray Connecting Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Transtar"}
