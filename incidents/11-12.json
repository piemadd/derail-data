BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF BOTH EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IT WAS DETERMINED THAT DRUGS AND ALCOHOL WERENOT INVOLVED, AND TESTING WAS NOT WARRANTED. AFTER CONSULTING SEVERAL RAIL CONSULTANTS, IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT EMPTY CARS CONTAINED IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONSIST MAY HAVE INCREASED THE RISK OF DERAILMENT.

AS THE CONDUCTOR REACHED THE REAR END OF THE TRAIN, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LAST 5 CARS OF THE TRAIN HAD DERAILED TO THE INSIDEOF THE CURVE. CAUSE OF DERAILMENT: CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DERAILMENT INDICATED THAT LOADED BOX CAR LRS15240 DERAILED TO THE INSIDE OF THE CURVE DUE TO A BROKEN RAIL ON THE INSIDE OR LOW RAIL. DERAILMENTOF THE FIRST CAR CAUSED THE RAIL ON THE HIGH SIDE TO TURN OVER THE OUTSIDE DERAILING FIRST ECUX 882336, WHICH WAS AHEAD OF LRS 15240, AND THEN EMPTY NOKL 533364.
