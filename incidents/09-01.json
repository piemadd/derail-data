AS THE SHOVE PROGRESSED,  CSX TRAIN 260 RECEIVED A 12 CAR COUNT FROM UMAN.  THIS WAS THE DISTANCE UMAN COULD SEE INTO TRACK A4, BUT HE COULD NOT SEE THE REAR OF THE TRAIN.  CSX TRAIN 260 DID NOT RECEIVE ANOTHER CAR DISTANCE, SO HE SLOWED TO 0.9 MPH.  WHEN  TRAIN 260 RECEIVED ANOTHER 12 CAR COUNT, CSX ENGINEER INCREASED THE THROTTLETO NOTCH 7.  BOTH UNITS WERE IN THE RUN POSITION, AND APPROX. 10 PSI BRAKE APPLICATION WAS USED DURING THE MOVEMENT.  CSX TRAIN 260 TRAVELED WESTWARD APPROX. 1.5 MIN. UNTIL A UDE OCCURRED.  THE  CSXCONDUCTOR WAS ON THE GROUND APPROX. 100 FEET FROM THE DERAILMENT, WATCHING THE SHOVE.  HE WAS MONITORING THE HUMP CHANNEL, 34-34.  CSX ENGINEER AND CPR UMAN WERE ON RADIO CHANNEL 88-88.  THE 1331 STRIP CREW AND CSX TRAIN 260 CONDUCTOR GAVE STOP SIGNS WHEN THE DERAILMENT OCCURRED.  INSPECTION OF THEDERAILMENT SITE SHOWED THE P.O.D. AT THE 4-5 SWITCH FROG.  THE WHEEL LIFTED OVER THE RAIL AND ONTO THE TIES DUE TO EXCESSIVE HEAD END BUFF FORCES.  TRACKS A4, A5, A6, AND 0-00 WERE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE.  A4 HAD APPROX. 600 FT OF DAMAGED RAIL AND 20 TIES TO REPLACE.  A5 HAD APPROX. 200 FT OF DAMAGE","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"1L","Class":"1L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SOO168516200109","Report Key":"SOO168516200109","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 -
