FOREMANWAS IN CONTROL OF THE MOVEMENT ON THE HEADEND ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE LOCOMOTIVE MOVING SOUTH AND SWITCHMAN WAS RIDING THE REAR CAR OF THE CUT. FOREMAN BEGAN TO SLOW THE MOVEMENT DOWN AS THEY WERE COMING UP TO THE 910 SWITCH. HE MADE THE NOTCHES OF ACCELERATION FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVE AND THENDECELERATING CORRECTLY BY NOTCHING FROM 10 TO 7 TO 4 TO COAST, TO STOP. THE DOWNLOAD CONFIRMS THISTHAT HE CONTROLLED THE MOVEMENT CORRECTLY AND THERE WAS NO TIR'S ON ANY LOCOMOTIVES THAT WOULD HAVEBEEN POINTED IN THAT DIRECTION. AT THE TIME OF THE IMPACT THE YSA30R-15 WAS TRAVELING AT 4MPH AT WHICH TIME THE SPEED SPIKED UP TO 14MPH. ALL THE CARS WERE BLED OFF BY THE CAR DEPARTMENT WHEN THEY DIDTHE INBOUND INSPECTIONS EARLIER IN THE DAY. THE TRACK AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION HAD A TOTAL OF166 CARS FROM THE INBOUND MMCSAS-09 AND THIS WAS THE 3RD CUT THAT WE TOOK OFF THE SOUTH END TO SWITCH. SOMEHOW THE UP218240 CAME UNCOUPLED FROM THE CMO15242 AND THAT CAUSED THE REAR 19 CARS OF THE CUTTO RUN INTO HEAD 7 CARS THAT WERE STILL CONNECTED TO THE RCL SET. AS WE INSPECTED THE CARS FROM THEDERAILMENT THERE WERE NO HAND BRAKES ON ANY OF THE CARS (WHICH THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN) AND ALLTHE CARS WERE COUPLED UP AT THAT POINT, BUT THE TRAIN LINE HOSE WAS UNCOUPLED BETWEEN THE UP218240 AND CMO15242 WHICH ALSO PROVES THAT THE CARS CAME UNCOUPLED.
