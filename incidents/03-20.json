FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE DERAILMENT OF THE CARS OCCURRED DUE TO BYPASS DRAWBARS DURING FLAT SWITCHING OPERATIONS WITH THE YBS39 21.  AFTER FINAL INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT, A M599 CODE IS BEING USED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: A HUMAN FACTOR CAUSE WAS NOT APPLIED BECAUSE THE CAR(S) IN QUESTION WERE RELEASED IN THE DESIGNATED PINNING ZONE AND ON TANGENT TRACK.  THE CARS WERE RELEASED BETWEEN 3 & 5 MPH AND COUPLING SPEEDS WERE AT 4 MPH BASED ON THE SPEED OF THE RELEASE, DISTANCE TRAVELED, AND THE GRADE OF THE TRACK.  THE DRAWBAR WAS NOT SLEWED UPON RELEASE AND THE KNUCKLE WAS OPEN AS VERIFIED BY THE INVESTIGATION FIELD OFFICERS.  A REVIEW OF ANY POSSIBLE MECHANICAL DEFECTS WAS EVALUATED AND THE CAR MEASUREMENTS WERE WITHIN ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF COUPLER HEIGHTS WHICH IS BETWEEN 31 & 34 INCHES DEPENDING ONLOAD/EMPTY, AND THE AMOUNT OF GREASE AT THE COUPLER CARRIER WAS IN ACCEPTED STANDARDS.  A REVIEW OFANY POSSIBLE ENGINERRING DEFECTS WAS CONDUCTED AND THE TRACK WAS FOUND TO BE WITHIN ACCEPTED STANDARDS WITH TRACK MEASUREMENTS OF RAIL CONDITION AND GAUGE WITHIN ACCEPTED STANDARDS.
