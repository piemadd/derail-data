THE DERAILMENT OCCURRED AT A JOINT. DUE TO VERY RECENT HEAVY RAINFALL, THE GROUND AND GRADE WERE SOFT AND THE TIES WERE SPONGY. THECREW FELT A JERK AND AN EMERGENCY APPLICATION OF THE TRAIN AIR BRAKES OCCURRED. WHEN THE CREW LOOKEDBACK, THEY SAW THAT THE TWO ABOVE CARS WERE ROLLING OVER ON THEIR SIDES. THESE TWO CARS PULLED THEADJACENT TWO CARS ON EITHER END WITH THEM SO THAT THE 6TH THROUGH 11TH CARS ROLLED ONTO THEIR SIDESON THE LOW (INSIDE) OF THE CURVE. DRUG TESTING WAS PERFORMED AT HENDRY CNTY HOSPITAL UNDER REASONABLE CAUSE ITEM #1 AT 7:30PM.
