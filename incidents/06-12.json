PREVIOUS INSPECTION REPORTS ABOUT THE BRIDGE CONDITIONNOTED DECK ROTTING AND DECAY, A FEW PILE CONDITIONS AND SETTLEMENT OF BENT #3.  THE TOP TIMBER BALLAST RETAINER OF A DOUBLE STACKED RETAINER ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE BRIDGE WAS REMOVED AND HAD NOTBEEN REINSTALLED FROM PROGRAM TIE WORK DURING THE PREVIOUS MONTHS.  FIVE DAYS PRIOR THE DERAILMENT HEAVY RAINS FELL IN THE AREA CAUSING FLASH FLOODING AND SIDE WASHING WITH THE SURROUNDING 5 MILES OFTHE BRIDGE.  THE TRACK WAS REMOVED FROM SERVICE UNTIL BALLAST COULD BE DUMPED AND THE TRACK INSPECTED. THIS SPECIFIC BRIDGE ALONG WITH OTHER LOCAL STRUCTURES HAD RECENTLY BEEN INSPECTED AND FOUND SAFETO RETURN THE MAIN TRACK BACK TO SERVICE.  THIS BRIDGE HAD FLOOD WATERS OVER THE TOP OF THE DECK FULLY SATURATING THE SUPERSTRUCTURE BY EVIDENCE OF TREE LIMBS AND DEBRIS ON THE DECK ALONG WITH BALLAST BEING SCOURED AWAY FROM THE ENDS OF THE UPSTREAM SIDE TIES.  BY EVIDENT OF VIDEO TRACK IMAGE RECORDINGS ON THE DERAILED TRAIN AND THE PREVIOUS TRAIN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT BALLAST LEAKED OUT THROUGH THE DECK ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE RIGHT OVER BENT #3.  DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF A SETTLED BENT #3, ROTTING DECKING, MISSING BALLAST RETAINER AND FLOOD WATERS SATURATING THE DECK THAT A HOLE IN THE DECK OPENED UP ALLOWING BALLAST TO LEAK OUT CAUSING A CROSS-LEVEL SITUATION IN THE TRACK DERAILING THE TRAIN.
