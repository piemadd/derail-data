THE L1 WHEEL CLIMBED THE GAGE FACE OF THE HIGH RAIL IN THE EXIT SPIRAL OF A 10 DEGREE LEFT HAND CURVE AT MP 301.80.  THE WHEEL THEN TRAVELED ON TOP OF THE RAIL FOR APPROXIMATELY 9\" 6'.  THE FIRST INDICATION OF WHEEL DOWN WAS ON THE FIELD SIDE OF THE HIGH RAIL AT 12\" 6' FROM POD.  THE TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY FROM THE DERAILED CAR CONTACTING THE SWITCH AT MP 304.25, CAUSING DAMAGE TO AND DERAILING AN ADDITIONAL THREE CARS.  TOTAL OF 4 CARS DERAILED.  WHILE THE MEASURED TRACK GEOMETRY DOES NOT MEET THE CLASS 2 REQUIREMENTS, THERE WAS A LARGE VARIATION IN CROSS LEVEL,SPECIFICALLY IN RELATION TO THE WHEELBASE OF THE DERAILED CAR AND THE POD.  THE WARP IN THE CAR CAUSED BY THE SIGNIFICANT RATE OF CHANGE IN CROSS LEVEL CREATES A SCENARIO WHERE THE LEADING OUTSIDE WHEEL UNLOADS, INCREASING THE RISK OF EXCESSIVE LATERAL OVER VERTICAL FORCES AND DERAILMENT.  SIMULATIONS SHOWED THE NOMINAL IMBALANCE MEASURED IN THE NS469379 AND THE IN-TRAIN FORCES IN THE AREA OF THEDERAILMENT ONLY SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE DERAILMENT RISK, THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN THE DERAILMENT WAS THE TRACK TWIST AND WARP PRESENT AT THE DERAILMENT LOCATION.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0114RS018201401","Report Key":"UP0114RS018201401","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
