WE CAME OFF A BRIDGE AT MP 12, THE TRACK WAS STRAIGHT THEN THE RAIL KINKED ABOUT HALF WAY BETWEEN THE TRAIN.  WE HAD 15 CARS AND TWO ENGINES.  IT DERAILED THE 12TH CAR, TURNED OVER THE 13TH AND 14TH CARS ON THEIR SIDE.  THE 15TH CAR JUST DERAILED.  FROM WHAT I CAN SEE, IT TORE UP ABOUT 30 TO 50 TIES AND ABOUT 300 FEET OF 112 LBS RAIL.  CAN'T TELL HOW MUCH DAMAGE TO THE RAILCARS UNTIL THE CREWS MOVE THEM, AND GET A CARMAN TO LOOK AT THEM.
