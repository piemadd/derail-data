OUR INVESTIGATION LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT THE LADDER WAS SUSPENDED LATERALLY FROM THE SIDE OF THE CAR.  AS THETRAIN TRAVELLED NORTH, THE LADDER STRUCK SOME LIGHT POLES, A FENCE AND AN EMPTY PASSENGER STATION PLATFORM.  THE LADDER EVENTUALLY DROPPED OFF THE CAR AND FELL ALONG THE ROADBED.  IT IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME WHICH CAR RHW LADDER FELL FROM AS THE TRAIN WAS INTERCHANGED BEFORE THE DAMAGE TO THE TRACKSIDE STRUCTURES WAS DISCOVERED.
