THE MOVE STARTED BY RADIO AND THEN WAS BROUGHT UP TO THE GROUNDMAN TO A STOP.  THE GROUNDMAN HOPPED ON THE EAST MOTOR TO PROTECT THE SHOVE AND GAVE HAND SIGNALS TO THE OPERATOR TO COME EAST WITHOUT SPECIFYING DISTANCE OR THAT THEY WERE SWITCHINGTO HAND SIGNALS.  THE OPERATOR BEGAN MOVING EAST WITHOUT BLOWING THE HORN AND WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGINGTHE COMMAND RECEIVED.  THE GROUNDMAN SAID HE SPECIFIED THE DISTANCE/DIRECTION BY RADIO AFTER THEY WERE ALREADY MOVING BUT HE HAD INADVERTENTLY BUMPED HIS RADIO TO ANOTHER CHANNEL, SO THE RADIO TRANSMISSION WAS NOT BROADCAST ON THE SAME CHANNEL AS THE OPERATOR.  THE OPERATOR FAILED TO STOP THE MOVEWITHIN HALF THE DISTANCE SPECIFIED AFTER THE GROUNDMAN WENT OUT OF SIGHT AROUND A CURVE, WHICH RESULTED IN A RUN THROUGH SWITCH.  THEY RAN THROUGH THE SWITCH, FINISHED THE MOVE TO PARK THE POWER ON E3TRACK AND NOTIFIED THE MANAGER ON DUTY.  NO DERAILMENT OR EQUIPMENT DAMAGE.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0520ME011202005","Report Key":"UP0520ME011202005","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
