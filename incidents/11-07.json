WTC.  While crossing over the east end of the Hack Bridge, the Engineer advised Control that he lost air and could not recharge the train. He instructed the Conductor to check for a pulled emergency valve and other potential air problems.  At the same time, passengers approached the Conductor and advised that the cars were sparking, smoking and cars were jumping in the back.  Upon looking out of the window, the Engineernoticed that the rear cars were in an unusual position and advised Control.  Upon further inspection, the Engineer learned that Cars 105 and 881 derailed. Control was advised and the Conductor movedall the passengers from the rear 4 cars up to the first 3 cars and waited for the rescue train.  Approximately 210 passengers and train crewmembers were transferred to the rescue train between 2:30am& 2:45am.  Of the 210, 2 passengers complained of injury but no reports were made.  The Engineer andConductor were taken for drug and alcohol testing which both proved negative results.   Authorizedspeed in the area is 55 mph.  An estimate of the actual speed the train was traveling was not possible to ascertain, as the train did not clear a full block.  There is also no audiovisual capability in this area, at this time.    \r\n\r\nAt the scene, 3 trucks were derailed: On Car 105, the F-end truckand one axel on the B-end derailed and on Car 881, the B -end truck.
