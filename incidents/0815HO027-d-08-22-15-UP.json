THE BR1 WAS STANDING BETWEEN TRACK5 AND 6 AND IN THE PROCESS OF RAMPING UP, THE CONDUCTOR WAS IN THE OFFICE MAKING A SWITCH LIST FOR THE CUT.  THE BR1 HAD DRAGGED UP ABOUT 10 CARS WHEN HE NOTICED SPARKS COMING OFF THE RAIL.  THE BR1 BROUGHT THE TRAIN TO A STOP AND NOTIFIED THE CONDUCTOR THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE.  AFTER WALKING DOWN THE CUT, THEY REALIZED THAT ECUX880383 WAS DERAILED.  THEY ALSO OBSERVED FPAX820036 DERAILED.  IT APPEARS THAT THE CARS BOTH HAD CLOSED KNUCKLES.  THE LHX02R HAD ALREADY KICKED 6 CARS ON TOP OF FPAX820036.  THE LHX03R KICKED AN ADDITIONAL 10 CARS IN THE TRACK BEFORE THEY COUPLED IN TO DRAG IT OUT.  GULF COAST MAINTAINS TRACK.
