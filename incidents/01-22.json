UPON REVIEW OF THE BRIDGE BY PURDUE UNIVERSITY STRUCTURAL EXPERT ROB CONOR, IAN ELLIOT, AND KYLE BAKER IT WAS DETERMINEDTHAT THE MOST PLAUSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE COLLAPSE IS A FAILURE OF FLOORBEAM 3 AT PANEL POINT L3 ON THENORTH TRUSS DUE TO THE PROPAGATION OF SHEAR CRACKING THROUGH THE WEB. THE BOTTOM COPED DETAILS OF THE FLOORBEAM CREATE A STRESS RISER AT THE POINT AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL PLANES OF THE WEB. THIS RISER IS SUBJECTED TO STRESS REVERSAL AND IS PRONE TO DEVELOPING FATIGUE CRACKING.
