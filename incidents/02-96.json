THE CONDUCTOR, WHILE WALKING THE TTAIN TO DETERMINE WHY TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY, FOUND CARS UTLX 96083 (METHYL CHLORIDE) AND DOWX 3468 (VINYLIDENE CHLORIDE)LAYING ON THEIR SIDES. CONDUCTOR NOTIFIED DISPATCHER WHO IN TURN NOTIFIED 911. IT WAS FOUND THAT THECARS WERE NOT LEAKING. INVE TIGATION OF THE CAUSE FOUND THAT THE LEAD WHEEL ON THE 1ST INVOLVED CARHAD DROPPED INSIDE THE RAIL CAUSING THE DERAILMENT. POOR TIE CONDITION CREATED A WIDE GAUGE CAUSINGWHEEL TO DROP OFF.
