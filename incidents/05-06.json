THE TRAIN CREW NOTIFIED OUR DISPATCHER AT 0340 HOURS ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THEN THE CP TRAIN DISPATCHER ABOUT THE DERAILMENT AND TOLD THEM TO HOLD ALL TRAINS UNTIL MAINTENANCE PEOPLE COULD MAKE A DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TO THE TRACKS.

THE CURVE DEVELOPED A PROFILE WITH A 3-1/2\" CROSS LEVEL PROMBLEM IN IT, AND WHEN THE COVERED HOPPER (NCUX 30238) WENT OVER THAT SPOT WITH THE LOADED GONDOLA CAR IT TWISTED THE HOPPER AND WALKER THE LEAD WHEEL OF THE HOPPER OVER THE HIGH RAIL IN THE CURVE.
