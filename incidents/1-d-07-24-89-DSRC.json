THE TRACK IN THIS AREA IS IN A 1 DEGREE, 30 MINUTE CURVE WITH 1&1/2\" ELEVATION. IT APPEARS THAT THE INSIDE RAIL SPREAD ALLOWING THE LEAD AXLE OF THE FOURTEENTH CAR TO DROP BETWEEN THE RAIL. THE LEAD TRUCK BEGAN SPREADING THE RAILS ALLOWING THE FOLLOWING CARS TO DERAIL. THE LEAD TRUCK ON THE FIFTEENTH CAR BEGAN TO PLOW TIES UNTIL IT TOTALLY DERAIL AND TURNED OVER ON ITS SIDE. WHEN THIS HAPPENED, IT PULLED THE FOURTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CARS OVER ONTO THEIR SIDE. THEY ROLLED OVERONCE COMING TO REST ON THEIR NORTH SIDES. WHEN THE CARS ROLLED OVER, THE PULL ON THE REAR OF THE THIRTEENTH CAR LIFTED THE LEAD AXLE OFF THE RAIL AND DROPPED IT ON THE GROUND. BECAUSE OF THE SLOW SPEED (7MPH) THE TRAIN CAME TO A HALT WITHIN ONE CARLENGTH. THE TIES IN THIS CURVE SHOWED DAMAGE FROM APREVIOUS DERAILMENT AND THE DEFECTIVE TIES WERE MARKED FOR REPLACEMENT. THIS WORK COMMENCE THE SAMEWEEK THAT THE DERAILMENT OCCURRED.
