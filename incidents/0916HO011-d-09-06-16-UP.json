THE CARS WERE EIGHTH AND NINTH CARS TOMOVE OVER THE SWITCH DURING THE SHOVE (BRKX66837, CCBX57588).  THE DERAILMENT WAS CAUSED BY AN UNLATCHED SWITCH.  AFTER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TRANSPORTATION AND MOW WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DERAILMENT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE CONTRACTOR INTERFERED WITH THE SWITCH.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0916HO011201609","Report Key":"UP0916HO011201609","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"Shippers","Other Railroad Class":"Class 3","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"WTBQ","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"W.
