CONDUCTOR IMMEDIATELY GAVE INSTRUCTIONS VIA RADIO TO STOP THE TRAIN.  AFTER STOPPING, THE DERAILED CARS LEANED OVER ON THEIR SIDES AND ROLLED OVER, DUMPING THE TRAINLINE AIR IN THE PROCESS.  THE TRAIN WAS NOT PLACED INTO EMERGENCY DURING THE STOP.  UPON INSPECTION, CONDUCTOR FOUND THAT THE FOUR CARS BEHIND THE TWO DERAILED CARS HAD ALSO TIPPED OVER, OUT OF VIEW BEHINDTHE TREES IN THE CURVE.  CONDUCTOR COMMUNICATED THE INFORMATION TO ENGINEER, BUT MISCOUNTED THE NUMBER OF ROLLED OVER CARS AS FOUR CENTER BEAMS RATHER THAN FIVE.  A CORRECT COUNT WAS GIVEN LATER IN THE DAY, BUT THE PROBLEM WAS COMPOUNDED BY A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN ENGINEER AND CONDUCTOR, ENGINERRHAVING BELIEVED THAT CONDUCTOR SAID FOUR CARS TOTAL WERE ON THEIR SIDES, NOT FOUR CENTER BEAMS PLUSTHE BALLAST CAR.  THE BOXCAR AHEAD OF THE BALLAST CAR ALSO HAD DERAILED ONE TRUCK, BUT DID NOT TIPOVER.  AFTER TYING NINE HANDBRAKES ON THE REMAINING 18 CARS THAT WERE STRANDED BEHIND THE DERAILMENT, AND SECURING THE BOXCAR THAT HAD PARTIALLY DERAILED, WE CUT AWAY AND PROCEEDED TO COCHRAN WITH THETWO LEADING BOXCARS TO AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"3S","Class":"3S","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"POTB01200503","Report Key":"POTB01200503","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"POTB","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Port Of Tillamook Bay Railroad","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"POTB","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Port Of Tillamook Bay Railroad","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
