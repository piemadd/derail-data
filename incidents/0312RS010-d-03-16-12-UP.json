THE CONDUCTOR FOUND A DERAILED CAR AND A CAR THAT HAD LOST A DOOR.  THE DOOR FROM A RAILCAR HAD FALLEN OFF AND EVENTUALLY WEDGED IN THE FROG FOR TRACK 729 WHICH CAUSED THE NDYX515329 TO DERAIL.  THE TRAIN TRAVELED ANOTHER 2300 FEET BEFORE GOING INTO EMERGENCY.  IT APPEARS THAT THE DUMP DOOR ON THE CMO850749 WAS NOT SHUT BY THE CUSTOMER AND AS THE TRAIN STARTED MOVING THE DOOR FELL OFF AND CAUSED THIS DERAILMENT.
