AFTER 3 OF THE CARS HAD BEEN UNLOADED, ASHGROVE'S TRACK MOBILE MOVED THE EMPTY CARS IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTIONTO ALLOW THE FOURTH AND LAST CAR TO BE POSITIONED OVER THE UNLOADING PIT. AFTER THE LOADED CAR WAS POSITIONED FOR UNLOADING, THE CARS WERE SECURED WITH HAND BRAKES, WHEEL CHOCKS AND BLUE FLAGS PRIOR TO THE TRACK MOBILE BEING UNCOUPLED. AS THE CAR WAS BEING UNLOADED, AN EMPLOYEE OF ASHGROVE CEMENT POSITIONED HIMSELF ON TOP OF CAR# UP 218148 AND NOTICED THE LOAD WAS CLINGING TO THE SIDES OF THE CARINSTEAD OF FLOWING IN A UNIFORM MANNER EVEN THOUGH PNEUMATIC VIBRATORS WERE APPLIED TO THE NORTH END& EAST SIDE OF THE CAR. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO TRY TO BREAK FREE THE CLINGING MATERIAL FROM THE SIDESOF THE CAR WITH AN ALUMINUM ROD APPROX 15 FEET LONG. IT APPEARS THAT WHEN THE LOAD RELEASED ON THEEAST SIDE OF THE CAR, AN UNFAVORABLE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION CAUSED THE CAR TO SLOWLY ROLL IN A WESTERLYDIRECTION ALSO CAUSING 2 OF THE PREVIOUSLY UNLOADED CARS TO ROLL ONTO THEIR SIDES.NoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SL9504291199504","Report Key":"SL9504291199504","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"SL","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Salt Lake City Southern Railroad Company, Incorporated","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"SL","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Salt Lake City Southern Railroad Company, Incorporated","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
