SOO FIELD OPS MANAGERS, ALONG WITH THE UP ROAD FOREMAN REVIEWED THE LOCOMOTIVE DOWNLOADS AT THE SCENE AND SEVERAL TIMES THEREAFTER, AND BOTH SOO & UP AGREED THAT TRAIN HANDLING WAS WELL WITHIN STANDARDS. CREW WAS SHOVING AT 4.1 MPH (AS INDICATED FROM LOCOMOTIVE DOWNLOAD), 100-200 AMPS, 1&2 NOTCH. NO AUTOMATIC AIR WAS USED. SOO ENGINEERING INSPECTION INDICATES LEAD TRUCK-2ND WHEEL NORTH SIDE ON THE TTGX 961932 HAD PICKED THE SWITCH. OBSERVED MISSING GAGE PLATES AT THE SWITCH. THERE WERE SPIKES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PLATES THAT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN PUT THERE TO KEEP CORRECT GAGE. ALSO VISIBLE THAT THE PLATES ON THE SOUTH SIDE HADBEEN PUSHED OUT, DIGGING INTO THE TIES, WHICH IS A SIGN OF WIDE GAGE. UP ADVISES TRACK REPAIRS $3,970.00.
