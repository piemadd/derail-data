AFTER COUPLING AND CHARGINGTHE AIR SYSTEM THE LOCOMOTIVES (GMTX 2000 & 2002) WERE UNABLE TO PULL THE ENTIRE STRING OF 44 LOADED CARS. THE DECISION WAS MADE TO MAKE A CUT AT CAR 26, PULL THESE CARS, WITH THE INTENTION OF RETURNING LATER TO PULL THE REMAINING 18 CARS. THE BRAKEMAN MOUNTED THE \"B\" END OF CAR 27 AND SET A HAND BRAKE. HE THEN WALKED BACK TO THE \"A\" END AND MISTAKENLY CLOSED THE ANGLE COCK ON CAR 27 (BOTTLING THE AIR). THE BRAKEMAN THEN REQUESTED A BUMP OF THE STRING TO ALLOW THE RELEASE OF THE COUPLER PIN, THE CARS WERE BUMPED, THE PIN WAS RELEASED AND THE TRAIN PULLED AWAY. WHEN THE AIR HOSES SEPARATED THETRAIN LOST AIR PRESSURE AND THE BRAKES WERE PUT INTO EMERGENCY APPLICATION. AT THAT POINT THE BRAKEMAN REALIZED THAT HE HAD CLOSED THE WRONG ANGLE COCK AND OBSERVED THE STRING OF CARS THAT WERE NOT ATTACHED TO THE LOCOMOTIVE ROLLING AWAY. THE GRADE OF TRACK 12 IS APPROXIMATELY 4%, THE CARS ACCELERATED QUICKLY AND THE BRAKEMAN WAS UNABLE TO CATCH THEM.

THE CREW HUMPED TWO CARSINTO TRACK M0-16 AND THEN HUMPED  TWO CARS INTO TRACK M0-15. THE CARS HUMPED INTO TRACK M0-16 DID NOT CLEAR AND THE TWO CARS DESTINED INTO TRACK M0-15 SIDE SWIPED THE CARS THAT DID NOT CLEAR INTO TRACK M0-16.

INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT FOUND THAT THE HPCS SYSTEM HAS TWO OS CIRCUITS PER TRACK FOLLOWED BY A CLEARANCE TRACK CIRCUIT BEGINNING AT THE SWITCH OF THE CLASSIFICATION TRACK. THE HPCS SYSTEM WILL NOT ALLOW THE SWITCHESTO LINE WHILE IT DETECTS CARS IN EITHER OF OS CIRCUITS. HOWEVER, ONCE A CAR CLEARS THE OS TRACK CIRCUIT AND ENTERS THE CLEARANCE TRACK, A 30 TO 50 SECONDS DELAY IS ALLOWED BEFORE THE HPCS SYSTEM DECLARES A CORNERING SITUATION AND APPLIES CORNERING PROTECTION TO THE TRACK. THIS TIME IS CALCULATED BYTHE SPEED MEASUREMENT OF THE HPCS SYSTEM AND VARIES FROM CAR TO CAR AND TRACK TO TRACK. THE HPCS SYSTEM HAD INADEQUATE TIME TO PROVIDE CORNERING PROTECTION AND GIVE NOTIFICATION TO YARDMASTER.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"IC686962201010","Report Key":"IC686962201010","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 -
