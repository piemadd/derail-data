CONDUCTOR #2 LINED THE NORTH LEG SWITCH FOR  MOVEMENT AND STATES THAT THE SOUTH LEG SWITCH IS ALREADY LINED FOR THEIR MOVEMENT.  CONDUCTOR #1 IS RIDING THE SHOVE (ON THE SOUTHSIDE OF THE TANK CAR)AND STATES THAT THE SOUTH LEG WYE WAS LINED FOR THEIR MOVEMENT.  AFTER REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SOUTH LEG WYE SWITCH WAS NOT LINED BACK PROPERLY AFTER THIS SAME CREW PARKED THE SKOL 3834 INTHE SOUTH LEG WYE.  ALL CREW MEMBERS CONFIRM THAT THEY DID NOT LINE THE SWITCH BACK FOR THE INTENDEDMOVEMENT AFTER PARKING THE SKOL 3834 IN THE WYE.  THIS WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE CREW TO RUN THRU THE SOUTH LEG WYE SWITCH ON THE EASTBOUND MOVEMENT.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SKOLD524911201111","Report Key":"SKOLD524911201111","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"SKOL","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"South Kansas & Oklahoma Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Watco","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"SKOL","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"South Kansas & Oklahoma Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Watco"}
