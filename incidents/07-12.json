HE THENLINED BOTH THE NORTH AND SOUTH CROSSOVER SWITCH FOR THE MOVEMENT OF THE GRW 320. HE THEN INFORMED THE GRW 320 OPERATOR THAT MOVEMENT WAS LINED THROUGH #7 CROSSOVER FOR THE GRW 320. WHILE STANDING NORTH OF THE SOUTH #7 CROSSOVER SWITCH THE GRW 317 OPERATOR STATED THAT HE THEN CONTINUED WITH MOVEMENTCLOSER TO THE CROSSOVER AND THOUGHT HE STOPPED.  HE LOOKED AWAY AND THEN LOOKED BACK AND REALIZED HIS MOVEMENT WAS NOT STOPPED AND THAT HIS CONSIST WAS FOULING THE CROSS OVER CAUSING A COLLISION WITHGRW 320.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"GRW19F071202201207","Report Key":"GRW19F071202201207","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 -
