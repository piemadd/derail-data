THIS MOVE REQUIRED DL-3 TO REQUEST HEADROOM NORTH ON THE NSMAIN TRACK IN ORDER TO REVERSE EAST TO THE STRAWBERRY HILL RUNNING TRACK.  AS DL-3 STARTED EAST THEENGINEER MADE A 10LB REDUCTION TO SLOW FOR LACKAWANNA AVENUE GRADE CROSSING.  DL-3 CONDUCTOR CONFIRMED CROSSING WAS CLEAR AND PROTECTED.  ENGINEER SLOWLY ADVANCED THE THROTTLE TO NOTCH 3 WHILE MAINTAINING A 10LB REDUCTION DUE TO STEEP GRADE.  ENGINEER ADVANCED THE THROTTLE TO NOTCH 4 AFTER CLEARINGTHE NORTH LEG WYE SWITCH.  IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT HE FELT SOMETHING UNUSUAL AND IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE TRAIN.  IT IS COMMON PRACTICE TO APPLY THE AUTOMATIC BRAKE AND POWER THE TRAIN AROUND THE CURVE AND DOWN THE STEEP GRADE AT THIS LOCATION.  IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE TRAIN WAS LONGER, HEAVIERAND EQUIPPED WITH MORE POWER.  ENGINEER INEXPERIENCE PLAYED A PART IN HIS INABILITY TO IDENTIFY TRACK LIMITATIONS AND POSSIBLE JACK KNIFE SITUATION.  THE MOVE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE WITH 52 LOADSAND 5 LOCOMOTIVES.  \r\n\r\nNO RULES VIOLATION, INJURY OR SIGNS OF IMPAIRMENT WERE EVIDENT FROM THE CREW.\r\n\r\nRE BLOCK 30 THIRD POSITION TYPE OF OPERATION: RULES THAT REQUIRE OPERATIONS AT RESTRICTED SPEED.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"DL170901201709","Report Key":"DL170901201709","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"DL","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"DELAWARE LACKAWANNA RAILROAD","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Genesee Valley","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"DL","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"DELAWARE LACKAWANNA RAILROAD","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Genesee Valley"}
