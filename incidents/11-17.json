THE CONDUCTOR PULLED THE CUT HIGH TO SHOVE EM02 AND INADVERTENTLY LINED THE EM10 SWITCH AGAINST HIMSELF AFTER LINING EM02 NORMAL. WHEN HE SHOVED HIS CUT OF CARS FOR EM03 HE TRAILED THROUGH THE EM10 SWITCH THAT WAS LINED AGAINST HIS MOVEMENT. AFTER SPOTTING EM03,HE PULLED APPROX. 400' NORTH TO GET OVER THE EM04 SWITCH AND WHEN THEY STARTED SHOVING HE SAW THE CONTAINERS START TO WOBBLE AND STOPPED THE MOVEMENT. THE MOVEMENT CAUSED DTTX 885052 TO TRACK DOWN EM10 WHILE THE OTHER CARS WERE TRACKING DOWN EM08. WHEN THEY SHOVED BACK TOWARDS EM04 THEY DERAILED DTTX 885052 AND DTTX 459190.
