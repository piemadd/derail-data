Y29212, AN RCO FOREMAN WAS SWITCHING WITHIN THE YARD NEXT TO THE MAINLINE AND SAW THAT THE CPDX 582101S LEAD TRUCK HAD DERAILED UNDER THE CAR BUT STILL COUPLED TO THE CAR AHEAD. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE CAR WAS OFF CENTER, THE LOCATION OF THE CENTER PIN WAS UNKNOWN, THE A-END TRUCK HAD COME OUT OF THE BOWL, MOVED BACK TOWARDS THE B END OF THE CAR AND LATER DERAILED. THERE WAS AHOLE PUNCHED INTO THE KNUCKLE OF CDPX 582101 FROM AN UNDETERMINED IMPACT WHICH MOST LIKELY WAS THE CAUSE OF THE CAR BEING KNOCKED OUT OF THE BOWL. THE CENTER PIN DOES NOT HOLD THE CAR BODY TO THE TRUCKS, AND WAS MOST LIKELY LOST LINE OF ROAD. A TA-5 WAS COMPLETED ON THIS CAR WITH NO EXCEPTIONS TAKEN.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"CSX000132052201407","Report Key":"CSX000132052201407","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation"}
