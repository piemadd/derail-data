THE CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT WAS DUE TO TRACK CONDITION INVOLVING THREE FACTORS:  (1) EXCESSIVE CURVE WEAR AND RAIL FLOW THROUGHOUT THE CURVELEADING UP TO AND THROUGH THE POINT OF DERAILMENT, SOUTH OF THE DUAL CONTROL SWITCH AT CP F030 NILES JUNCTION.  (2) RAIL TRANSITION BETWEEN THE INSULATED JOINT PLUG 141 LB RAIL TO HEAVILY WORN 136 LBRAIL.  NON-FUNCTIONING RAIL LUBRICATOR IMMEDIATELY SOUTH OF THE CURVE WHERE DERAILMENT OCCURRED.  THE RAIL SHOWED SIGNS OF PAST RAIL LUBRICATION, BUT IT WAS VERY DRY AT THE TIME OF THE DERAILMENT.  THESE THREE FACTORS TOGETHER CAUSED THE WHEELS OF THE LEADING TRUCK OF E/205 TO CLIMB THE RAIL, RESULTING IN THE DERAILMENT.
