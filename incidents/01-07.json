LOCOMOTIVE 4327 WAS AT OFFICERS JUNCTION.  I INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER TO ASSIST IN SHOVING THE TRAIN OVER THE HILL.  I WAS STANDING AT COUNTY ROAD 13 AWAITING THERETURN MOVEMENT OF 4327.  I COULD SEE THAT AS THE 2233 CROSSED HIGHWAY 34, IT DERAILED.  RADIO COMMUNICATION WAS GIVEN TO THE ENGINEER ON THE 4327 TO STOP THE SHOVING MOVEMENT.  THE 2233 MOVED ON ABOUT TWO CAR LENGTHS FROM THE POINT OF THE DERAILMENT AND THEN FELL OVER ON THE ENGINEER'S SIDE WHEN ITREACHED A SMALL BRIDGE CROSSING A LARGE IRRIGATION DITCH.  UPON REACHING THE GRADE CROSSING TWO BNSF EMPLOYEES REPORTED THAT THEY WERE AT THE CROSSING WHEN THE DERAILMNET OCCURRED.  THEY STATED THATTHE TRAILING END OF THE LOCOMOTIVE CAME IN CONTACT WITH ONE OF THE CEMENT PLANKS, PULLING IT UP FROMTHE ROADBED AND DERAILING THE LOCOMOTIVE. WHEN THE LOCOMOTIVE FELL OVER, CAR NUMBER SRV 5127 CONTINUED TO MOVE A HEAD.  IT MADE CONTACT WITH THE LOCOMOTIVE CAUSING EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE AL CORNER OF THE CAR.  NUMBER THREE AND FOUR WHEELS DERAILED. THE ENGINEER REPORTED THAT HE HAD HIT HIS KNEE ONTHE CONTROL STAND.  HE DID NOT FEEL THAT HE NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION . THE CONDUCTOR FELL TO THE ENGINEER'S SIDE OF THE CAB WHEN IT WENT OVER.  HE REPORTED NO INJURIES AT THE TIME.

JANUARY 19-20, 2006.  AT APPROXIMATELY 0245 HOURS, THE TRAIN PASSED GREENWOOD (MILEPOST CA 198.9), A CARABOUT 60 CARS DEEP IN THE CONSIST, HAD BRAKE RIGGING DRAGGING ON THE BALL OF THE RAIL.  THIS EQUIPMENT WAS POSSIBLY DRAGGING FOR SEVERAL MILES BEFORE MILEPOST CA 198.9.  THE DRAGGING EQUIPMENT APPARENTLY CAUSED A FOLLOWING CAR (CSXT 387566) TO DERAIL A WHEEL.  THIS OCCURRED ON THE HIGH SIDE OF A LEFT HAND CURVE.  AT THE WEST END OF AFTON SIDING (MILEPOST CA 204.1), A SECOND WHEEL DERAILED; THEREWAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE SWITCH: CLOSURE RAIL PULLED OUT OF PLATES, FROG BOLT BROKEN, FIVE HEELBLOCKS BROKEN, AND CONNECTING RODS BENT CAUSING THE SWITCH POINT TO GAP.  THERE WAS SUSPENSION SPRINGS LEFT AT THE SWITCH LOCATION (INDICATING WHEEL[S] ON THE GROUND).  THE TRAIN PROCEEDED (WITH TWOWHEELS ON THE GROUND) TO MILEPOST CA 207.8 WHERE THREE CARS TOTALLY LEFT THE RAILS AND 7 CARS BEHINDHAD DIFFERING NUMBERS OF WHEELS ON THE GROUND.  TWO BRIDGES, OVER CITY STREETS AND ANOTHER RAILROAD, HAD WALKWAYS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF EACH BRIDGE, TORN OUT.  ONE CAR CAUGHT A SECURITY FENCE AROUND TWO RAILROAD BUILDINGS.  THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THIS CYCLONE FENCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE GENERAL PILE-UP.  THE FENCE APPEARS TO HAVE CAUGHT MATERIAL ON THE GROUND AND PULLED THE CAR TOTALLY OFF THE RAIL.  AT THAT POINT, THE BRAKE AIR LINE WAS BROKEN; THE TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY.
