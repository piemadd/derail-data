UPON INVESTIGSTION THE CONDUCTOR FOUND TWO EMPTY COVERED HOPPERS CARS ON THE GROUND, NCUX 30238 AND DME 51245. THESE CARS WERE THE 67TH AND 69TH CARS IN THE TRAINS CONSIST.  ONE OF THE CONDUCTORS WALKED BACK TO SEE WHERE THE POD (POINT OF DERAILMENT) WAS, HE WALKED BACK APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE, AND STILL HADN'T FOUND WHERE THE CARS WENT OFF THE RAIL.  THE TRAIN CREW NOTIFIED OUR DISPATCHER AT 0340 HOURS ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THEN THE CP TRAIN DISPATCHER ABOUT THE DERAILMENT AND TOLD THEM TO HOLD ALL TRAINS UNTIL MAINTENANCE PEOPLE COULD MAKE A DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TO THE TRACKS.  UPON INVESTIGATION WE FOUND THAT THE POD WAS AT MILE A81.05, WHICH IS ON A CURVE.
