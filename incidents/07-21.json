TTZX87782 AND TBOX672508 DERAILED AT THE FROG AT 306 SOUTH.  THE LLM21R-25 CONDUCTOR STOPPED THE MOVEMENT AFTER NOTICING THE CARSDRAGGING ON THE GROUND.  THE TBOX672508 TRAVELED 590 FEET FROM THE POINT OF DERAILMENT, INTO 306 BEFORE STOPPING, AT WHICH POINT THE TTZX87782 CONTINUED SLIDING FOR 634 FEET.  INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED AND FOR THIS DERAILMENT THAT OCCURRED AT 1800 ON 7/25/21.  THE MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT DID A FULLMECHANICAL INSPECTION AND MEASUREMENT OF BOTH CARS (TBOX672508 AND TTZX87782) AFTER THE DERAILMENT AND DID NOT FIND ANY OF THE METRICS TO BE OUT OF UP OR FEDERAL STANDARD.  TRACK MEASUREMENTS WERE REVIEWED BY THREE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT AND FOUND ALL MEASUREMENTS WERE WITHIN INCH OF DEVIATION.  THE DOWNLOAD OF THE REMOTE CONTROL LOCOMOTIVE CONSIST WAS REVIEWED BY FOUR OPERATING PRACTICES MANAGERS AND THERE WERE NO EXCEPTIONS TAKEN TO THE HANDLING OF THE CONSIST DURING THIS MOVE.  THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE TIR FOOTAGE OFF ENGINE UP 5813 THAT WAS IN TRACK 309 ON THE TRAINMLINSB-25, DID NOT REVEAL ANY SEVERE SLACK OR ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS.  THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL TRACK ANDMECHANICAL MEASUREMENTS, INCLUDING MULTIPLE REVIEWS OF THE DOWNLOADS REVEALED NO DEFINITIVE CAUSE OFTHE DERAILMENT.  LATERAL/VERTICAL FORCES WHILE THIS CUT TRAVERSED OVER THE POD ARE THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0721GC022202107","Report Key":"UP0721GC022202107","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 -
