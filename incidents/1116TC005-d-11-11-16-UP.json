UPON WALKING THE TRAIN, THE CONDUCTOR DISCOVERED 22 CARS DERAILED, INCLUDING 2 HAZMAT CARS, 1 HAD A RELEASE.  INVESTIGATION RULED OUT TRAIN HANDLING FROM LOCOMOTIVE DOWNLOAD AND USE OF THE SIMULATOR TO DETERMINE EXACT BLUFF AND DRAFT FORCES PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE TRAIN.  ALL MECHANICAL COMPONENTS WERE RETRIEVED AND NO WHEELS WERECONDEMNABLE, NO WHEELS OR CARS INDICATED ABNORMAL PATTERNS OF WEAR AND THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OFBROKEN MECHANICAL COMPONENTS ON ANY CARS.  MOST TRACK COMPONENTS WERE RECOVERED AS INDICATED BY MEASUREMENT OF TRACK FOOTAGE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 71' OF RAIL.  THE DERAILMENT LOCATION WAS ON A HIGH FILL LOCATION AND DID NOT WANT TO DISTURB THE ROADBED ANY MORE THAN WE HAD TO FROM RERAILING/CLEARINGOPERATIONS BY DIGGING OUT THE COMPACTED RIGHT-OF-WAY LOOKING FOR THE BROKEN RAIL.  BY THE CATASTROPHIC NATURE OF THE DERAILMENT PILE AND THE RECOVERY OF ALL MECHANICAL COMPONENTS AND RE-CREATION IN THE SIMULATOR, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS DERAILMENT WAS CAUSED BY A RAIL DEFECT.
