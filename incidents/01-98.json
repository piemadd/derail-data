AS THE TRAIN WAS APPROACHING TUNNEL SECTION HOUSE, THE ENGINEERWAS OPERATING THE SIX UNIT IN THE 6TH THROTTLE POSITION TO MAINTAIN A SPEED OF 15 MPH.  WHEN THE TRAIN BEGAN TO NEGOTIATE THE 3% ASCENDING GRADE SOUTH OF MP 51, THE LEAD UNITBEGAN TO INTERMITTENTLY DROP ITS LOAD.  THE TRAIN SPEED DECREASED TO ABOUT ONE MPH AND THE ENGINEERMADE A BRAKE APPLICATION TO HOLD THE TRAIN ON THE GRADE.  THE ENGINEER THEN MADE A REVERSE MOVEMENTTO ASSURE THAT THE BRAKES WOULD HOLD THE TRAIN.  AT THIS TIME, THE ENGINEER DETERMINED THAT HE MAYNOT ABLE TO CONTROL THE TRAIN SPEED IN REVERSE MOVEMENT FROM THE POINT WHERE THE TRAIN STALLED.  ITWAS THEN DECIDED TO ALLOW THE EXCESS TONNAGE, THE CARS, TO STAND BETWEEN MP 49.8 AND MP 49.6.  THE BRAKEMAN THEN WALKED BACK AND AFTER SETTING THE HANDBRAKE ON  THE SOUTH SIX CARS OF THE CUT TO BE LEFT,UNCOUPLED THE CARS, AND RODE ON THE SOUTH CAR OF A 17 CAR CUT WHILE THE TRAIN PROCEEDED TO GRANDVIEW.
