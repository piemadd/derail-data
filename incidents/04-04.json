NO INJURIES REPORTED.  FOR COMPLETE DESCRIPTION AND INVESTIGATION RESULTS REFER TO ATTACHED DOCUMENTATION.    BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  25 CARS ROLLED OUT OF R-2 THROUGH THE DUPONT XO ONTO THE MAIN TRACK WHERE THEY COLLIDEDWITH AN ES WELDING TRUCK. THIS INCIDENT WAS INVESTIGATED BY ALL THREE FUNCTIONS. INITIAL TRAIN INSPECTION BY MS FOUND NO AIR ON THE 25 CARS AND 7 HANDBRAKES APPLIED. ES FORCES VERIFIED THAT THEY HAD APPLIED THE 7 HANDBRAKES TO THE CARS IN ORDER TO BRING TO A STOP. THE FOUR HANDBRAKES PREVIOUSLY APPLIED BY THE SWITCH CREW WERE COMPLETELY RELEASED WHEN ENCOUNTERED BY ES.      IN SIMULATIONS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CARS WOULD NOT REMAIN STATIONARY ON R-2 WITHOUT HAND BRAKES APPLIED. MOVEMENT WASIMMEDIATE. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT HANDBRAKES WERE PREVIOUSLY APPLIED TO THE 25 CARS.     THREE DAYSLATER A FIRE WAS SET IN A GONDOLA AT HUMBOLDT YARD. TWO DAYS AFTER THAT ES MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT WAS VANDALIZED WITH BROKEN WINDOWS AND FIRE EXTINGUISHERS USED.     VANDALISM IS NOT A POPULAR CAUSE CODE. ONE - IT IS HARD TO PROVE VERSE CREW ERROR AND SECOND, IT IS HARD TO PROTECT AGAINST DUE TO ITSRANDOMNESS. HOWEVER, THE CREW INSISTED THEY HAD SECURED THE EQUIPMENT AND SUBSEQUENT SIMULATIONS DETERMINING THE CARS WILL NOT STAND WITHOUT SECUREMENT APPEARS TO VERIFY THEIR STATEMENTS.
