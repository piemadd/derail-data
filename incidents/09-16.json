FOREMAN STAYED ON THE ENGINE TO PULL THE 141 CARS OUT PAST THE 115 SWITCH AND TOOVERRIDE THE RCL STOP PROTECTION, DURING THE MOVE TO PULL OUT THE CARS THEY EXPERIENCED A COMMUNICATION LOSS.  THEY STOPPED AND RECOVERED AND PULLED 5 MORE CARS TO GET OVER THE 115 SWITCH.  CONTROL WAS PITCHED TO SWITCHMAN SO HE COULD START THE SHOVE MOVE INTO 115.  DURING THE SHOVE MOVE THEY EXPERIENCED ANOTHER COMMUNICATION LOSS (WE BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE THEY DERAILED).  AFTER STOPPING SWITCHMAN RECOVERED THE COMMUNICATION LOSS AND STARTED TO SHOVE AGAIN, THE ENGINE STARTED TO MOVE FOR A COUPLE OF CARS AND THEN THEY LOST POWER AND SPEED AND THEN SWITCHMAN NOTICED ONE OF THE CARS WAS SIDEWAYS AND THEY WERE ON THE GROUND.
