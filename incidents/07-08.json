THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE HAND BRAKE ON THE NS 486748WOULD NOT HOLD THE TWO EMPTY CARS FROM THE SPOT IN WHICH THEY WERE CUT OFF FROM.  THE HAND BRAKE ONTHE NS 486748 INDEED HAD A MECHANICAL FAILURE.    \r\n\r\nAT 0815 HRS ON 8/1/08 THE CHIEF INSPECTOR ANDMECHANICAL INSPECTOR FROM THE FRA ARRIVED AT MVP.
