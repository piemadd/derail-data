THE BRAKEMAN WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE NORTH END OF THE YARD TO PROTECT THE SHOVE ON N266 ANDSTARTED TO TIE HANDBRAKES ON TRACK N074 TO SLOW THE CUT OF CARS SO THAT THEY WOULD MAKE A SLOWER COUPLING.  THE CREW NOTICED THE CARS HAD ROLLED INTO THE OTHER CARS IN THE TRACK AND THE BRAKEMAN REMOVED HIS HANDBRAKES AND CONTINUED NORTH.  THEY STRETCHED THE TRACK AGAIN AND THE BRAKEMAN VERIFIED THAT THE 2 NORTH CARS WERE MOVING SOUTH.  THE CREW DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE COUPLING HAD NOT MADE AND THE CARS WERE ROLLING WITH THE SOUTH SLOPE OF THE YARD.  THEY ASSUMED ALL THE CARS WERE TOGETHER ON N074 AND PULLED SOUTH.
