UPON INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE LEAD RIGHT HAND WHEEL OFTHE NORTH TRUCK ON ENGINE 716 HAD GONE ON GROUND ALONG WITH THE LEAD RIGHT HAND WHEEL OF THE FOLLOWING TRUCK ON THE ENGINE AND THE LEAD RIGHT HAND WHEEL OF THE FIRST COACH BEHIND THE ENGINE.  THE ENGINE TRAVELED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN FEET (116') ON THE GROUND FROM POD (POINT OF DERAILMENT) TO WHERE THE ENGINE CAME TO A STOP.
