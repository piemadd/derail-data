THE CREW HUMPED TWO CARSINTO TRACK M0-16 AND THEN HUMPED  TWO CARS INTO TRACK M0-15. THE CARS HUMPED INTO TRACK M0-16 DID NOT CLEAR AND THE TWO CARS DESTINED INTO TRACK M0-15 SIDE SWIPED THE CARS THAT DID NOT CLEAR INTO TRACK M0-16. THERE WERE FOUR CARS INVOLVED ALL DANGEROUS RESIDUE CARS; GATX 61822, TILX 600154, SHPX 240415 AND SHPX 240412. THERE WERE NO LEAKS OR EXPOSURE AND NO CARS DERAILED. INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT FOUND THAT THE HPCS SYSTEM HAS TWO OS CIRCUITS PER TRACK FOLLOWED BY A CLEARANCE TRACK CIRCUIT BEGINNING AT THE SWITCH OF THE CLASSIFICATION TRACK. THE HPCS SYSTEM WILL NOT ALLOW THE SWITCHESTO LINE WHILE IT DETECTS CARS IN EITHER OF OS CIRCUITS. HOWEVER, ONCE A CAR CLEARS THE OS TRACK CIRCUIT AND ENTERS THE CLEARANCE TRACK, A 30 TO 50 SECONDS DELAY IS ALLOWED BEFORE THE HPCS SYSTEM DECLARES A CORNERING SITUATION AND APPLIES CORNERING PROTECTION TO THE TRACK. THIS TIME IS CALCULATED BYTHE SPEED MEASUREMENT OF THE HPCS SYSTEM AND VARIES FROM CAR TO CAR AND TRACK TO TRACK. THE HPCS SYSTEM HAD INADEQUATE TIME TO PROVIDE CORNERING PROTECTION AND GIVE NOTIFICATION TO YARDMASTER.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"IC686962201010","Report Key":"IC686962201010","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America"}
