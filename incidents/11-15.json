THE DERAILMENT WAS CAUSED WHEN A RAILBROKE UNDER THE TRAIN. THE SPECIFIC RAIL, 100#RA RAIL ROLLED IN 1928, HAD A TRANSVERSE FISSURE DEFECT THAT PROGRESSED THROUGH THE WEB INTO THE BASE. THE TOP OF THE HEAD AND THE BOTTOM OF THE BASE HADNO BROKEN THROUGH. THE SECTION OF THE TRACK HAD BEEN SURFACED A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE DERAILMENT ANDTHE PROCESS OF LIFTING THE RAILS IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CAUSED THE CRACK TO PROGRESS FURTHER. THE RAILSTILL HAD NOT BROKEN THROUGH AT THIS POINT BUT WHEN PT-13 TRAVELED OVER THE SECTION, THE RAIL FLEXED AND BROKE UNDER THE TRAIN. AS THE BREAK WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY A TIE, THE RAIL GAVE WAY UNDER THE 15TH CAR WHERE THE DERAILMENT STARTED. THE ESTIMATED SPEED OF THE TRAIN AT THE TIME OF THE DERAILMENTWAS LESS THAN 10 MPH. THIS WAS DETERMINED BY THE FACT THAT ONLY 80 FEET OF TRACK WAS DAMAGED.
