THE CREW WAS USING THE NORTH LEG OF THE WYE FOR HEAD ROOM WITH THE TRAIN GOING FROM BRIDGE JUNCTION EAST OF THE WYE, AROUND THE WYE INTOTHE ICE HOUSE YARD. THEY HAD 3 LOCOMOTIVES ON THEHEAD END WITH 2 LOCOMOTIVES ON LINE AND 1 ISOLATED.THEY HAD A HOLD OF 6419 TONS AND 4759 FEET OF TRAIN. THEY SHOVED WEST ON THE DESCENDING GRADE TO CLEAR ICE 9 TRACK AND SET OUT 2 CARS ON THE LEAD. THEY THEN PULLED FORWARD (EAST) PAST THE ICE 9 SWITCH. THE SWITCH WAS THEN LINED FOR ICE 9 TRACK AND THE SW1 REQUESTED A PIN FROM THE ENGINEER AND PINNED 3 CARS INTO ICE 9 TRACK AND REQUESTED THE ENGINEER TO STOP. THERE WAS NO AIR AND NO HANDBRAKES ONTHE CUT OF CARS. WHEN THE ENGINEER GAVE THE PIN,IT BUNCHED THE SLACK ON THE CARS ON A DESCENDING GRADE SO WHEN THE ENGINEER STOPPED ON THE HEAD END IT CAUSED THE SLACK TO RUN OUT FROM THE WEIGHT OF THE TRAIN AND RESULTED IN A STRINGLINE DERAILMENT OF 8 CARS ON THE CURVE OF THE WYE. AT THIS TIME THECREW WERE UNAWARE THAT THEY HAD DERAILED AND REQUESTED THE ENGINEER TO TAKE THEM AHEAD. WHEN THE ENGINEER WAS PULLING AHEAD THE CREW MEMBERS ASKED AGAIN FOR THE ENGINEER TO PULL AHEAD AND THAT IS WHENTHE ENGINEER REALIZED THAT HE WAS MOVING ON THEHEAD END BUT THE CARS WERE NOT MOVING ON THE REAR SOHE THEN STOPPED THE MOVE KNOWING THEY WERE NOT TOGETHER.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0721RM009202107","Report Key":"UP0721RM009202107","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
