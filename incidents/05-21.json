AFTER MOVING APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET NORTHWARD, THE L3 WHEEL OF THE FIRSTCAR IN THE CUT DROPPED OFF THE INSIDE OF THE RAIL.  THE MOVEMENT CONTAINED ANOTHER 1098 FEET FROM THIS POINT UNTIL STOPPING.  THE BRAKEMAN TIED HAND BRAKES ON THE REAR TWO CARS AND CUT AWAY, NEVER SEEING THE WHEEL ON THE GROUND DUE TO WALKING THE CUT ON THE EAST SIDE.  AFTER CUTTING AWAY FROM THE CARS, THEY COUPLED INTO FOUR LOADED HOPPER CARS, SHOVED NORTH OUT OF TRACK 820, AND RAN AROUND THEIRCARS.  AFTER COUPLING INTO THE TANK CARS THAT THEY HAD LEFT AT THE SOUTH END, THEY BEGAN TO PULL SOUTH.  AT THIS POINT, THE ENGINEER NOTICED EXCESSIVE POWER WAS NEEDED TO MOVE AND STOPPED.

WHEN THE HEAD END OF THE TRAIN HAD REACHED THE BASE OF THEGRADE WHERE IT WAS LEVEL FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE, BEFORE ASCENDING A SIMILAR GRADE, THE ENGINEER WENT FROM SET UP TO IDLE.  IN PTB WE WERE ABLE TO SEE AFTER THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEALOF BUFF FORCE IN APPROXIMATELY THE 40 CARS RIGHT BEHIND THE CAR THAT WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE DERAILED FIRST.  THE ENGINEER DIDN'T VIOLATE ANY TRAIN HANDLING RULES BUT COULD HAVE HAD THE MID TRAIN DISTRIBUTIVE POWER FENCE-UP AND APPLIED ADDITIONAL POWER FROM THAT LOCOMOTIVE TO CONTROL RUN IN AND RUNOUT.  THIS IS POTENTIALLY AN ISSUE WITH THE COMBINATION OF TRAIN MAKEUP WITH MULTIPLE CUSHIONED DRAWBAR CARS INTERACTING WITH THE FORCE THAT IS BEING CAUSED.  MEANING, THE REASON THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A TRAIN HANDLING RULE VIOLATION, THE COMBINATION OF THE DRAWBARS AND THE TRAIN HANDLING RESULTEDIN A CAR WITH A CUSHIONED DRAWBAR TO BE FORCED OUT OF THE TRAIN AT THE BOTTOM OF A GRADE (AND IN A SLIGHT CURVE).  WITHOUT THE TRAIN BEING BUILT WITH MULTIPLE CUSHIONED DRAWBARS, AS A MID DPU TRAIN, THIS TRAIN HANDLING WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A CONCERN FOR DERAILMENT.
