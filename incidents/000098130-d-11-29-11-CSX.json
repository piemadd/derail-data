THE CREW HAD PULLED 30 CARS OUT SOLVAY 6AND DOUBLED TO FLINT 6 WHICH HAD 27 CARS IN THE TRACK.  WHEN THE CREW COUPLED TO FLINT 6 THE 23RD CAR FROM THE HEAD END DERAILED DUE TO THE CAR BEING OFF CENTER AND OUT OF THE BOWL.  THE CREW WAS 7 CAR LENGTHS WEST OF THE DERAILED CAR AND DID NOT REALIZE THE CAR DERAILED.  AFTER COUPLING TO FLINT 6THEY CREW PULLED WEST TO DOUBLE TO FLINT 5 AND THE DERAILED CAR RAN THRU A SWITCH AND DAMAGED THE TRACK BED IN THE PROCESS. THIS CAUSED 6 OTHER CARS TO DERAIL BEHIND IT, BUT RE-RE-RAILED WHEN THEY TRAVERSED OVER THE NEXT FROG.  WHEN THE CREW CLEARED FLINT 6 THE MOVE WAS TO DOUBLE TO FLINT 5, ONCE THE SWITCH WAS LINED FOR FLINT 5 THE CREW SHOVED BACK 3 CARS AND LOST THE AIR ON THE TRAIN PRIOR TO COUPLING TO FLINT 5.  WHILE MAKING THE REVERSE MOVE THRU THE RUN THRU SWITCH, THIS CAUSED THE GENERALPILE UP AND DERAILED 12 ADDITIONAL CARS.  THE CONDUCTOR WALKED THE TRAIN AND SAW THE CARS DERAILED AND CALLED FOR ASSISTANCE.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"CSX000098130201111","Report Key":"CSX000098130201111","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation"}
