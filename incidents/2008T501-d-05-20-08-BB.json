THE YARD CREW HAD 36 CARS ON THE REAROF THE LOCOMOTIVE; THEY WENT INTO ONE OF THE INDUSTRIES TO PICK UP 4 CARS ON THE HEAD OF THE LOCOMOTIVE.  TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MOVE, THE CUT OF CARS HAD TO BE MOVED NORTH OF THE SWITCH TO THE INDUSTRY.THE NORTH END OF THE CUT WAS NEAR THE TURN OUT FROM THE BANK TRACK TO YARD #4 TRACK.

WHEN THE CUT MOVED NORTH, THE REAR TWO CARS RAN THROUGH THE SWITCH (WHICH WAS LINED FOR MOVEMENT FROM #4 YARD TO #4 YARD TRACK.  THE CREW, AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CUT PROCEEDED TO MAKE TWO MORE MOVES, ONE SOUTH, (WHICH DERAILED THE CARS) AND ONE MORE NORTH.  AT THIS TIME THE ENGINEER FELT THAT THE MOVEMENT WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE; THEY INVESTIGATED AND FOUND THE TWO CARS DERAI","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"BB2008T501200805","Report Key":"BB2008T501200805","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"BB","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Buckingham Branch Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"BB","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Buckingham Branch Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
