THE TRAIN GAINED MOMENTUM ON THE DOWN SLOPEOF THE CURVED TRACK (THAT WAS OUT-OF-SERVICE, POWER REMOVED).  CAR 809 DERAILED AFTER PLUNGING THROUGH THE LOCKED FENCE AND COLLIDING WITH THE 71 E SWITCH PANEL THAT WAS BEING CONSTRUCTED, PUSHING ITBACK APPROXIMATELY 175 FEET ALONG WITH THE PEM-LEM TRACK LIFTING MACHINE AND TRUCK UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN.  SEVERAL OF THE TIES ON THE WOODEN PLATFORM MERGED TOGETHER AND CLOSED THE NORMAL 21-INCH GAP.STAFF FROM ALL CAR EQUIPMENT, TRANSPORTATION, POWER, SIGNALS & COMMUNICATIONS AND WAY & STRUCTURESRESPONDED TO THE SCENE.
