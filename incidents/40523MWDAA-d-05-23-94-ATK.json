TRAIN 7 WAS OPERATING ON A SINGLE MAIN TRACK, IN CTC TERRITORY, THROUGH A 1 DEGREE CURVE TO THE RIGHT. A 25 MPH SLOW ORDER WAS IN EFFECT BEGINNING AT MP 48.1 AS A RESULT OF A M/W UNDERCUTTER OPERATION. THE DERAILMENT OCCURRED WHEN THE #7 WHEEL TRAVERSED A LOW SPOT ON THE NORTH RAIL DUE TO IMPROPER CROSS LEVEL BETWEEN THE RAILS. THIS CAUSED #8 WHEEL TO LIFT ONTO THE BALL OF THESOUTH RAIL. THE #8 WHEEL THEN DROPPED OFF TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE SOUTH RAIL WHILE THE #7 WHEEL DROPPED INTO THE GAGE OF THE TRACK.
