GUNNELL, #5404 AND CONDUCTOR R. DIPAULA, #7675, WERE MOVING A WORK TRAIN (CONSIST - FLAT28-1205-1244-1209) TO ASSIGNED WORK RIGHTS IN TUNNEL A3. APPROACHING SIGNAL #138Z, THE FRONT OF THEFLAT SLID TO THE RIGHT. HE APPLIED HIS BRAKE IN THE FULL SERVICE POSITION. THE #1 TRUCK OF FLAT 28DERAILED AND CAME TO A STOP 50 FT FROM THE POINT OF DERAILMENT. THE DERAILED PORTION OF THE FLAT CAUSED DAMAGE TO A SECTION OF THE THIRD RAIL AND TO SIGNAL EQUIPMENT. DAMAGE TO FLAT #28 WAS MINIMAL. TOTAL DAMAGE WAS DETERMINED TO BE $21,000. INVESTIGATION INDICATED THE #1 TRUCK FLANGE CLIMBED THE RAIL 10 FT BEFORE IT WENT ON THE GROUND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GUARD RAIL SECTION. THE FLAT WAS COMING FROM A LEFT CURVE INTO A RIGHT CURVE ON A 4% DOWNHILL GRADE. A DESIGN DEFECT OF THIS \"MINER\" FLATCAR IS THE SUSPECTED CAUSE. HOWEVER, AN INSPECTION OF THIS FLAT CANNOT SUBSTANTIATE THIS AS THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT. CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE ASSIGNED THE CAUSE CODE AS M599.NoneNoneNoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"PATH395199506","Report Key":"PATH395199506","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"PATH","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Port Authority Trans Hudson","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"PATH","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Port Authority Trans Hudson","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
