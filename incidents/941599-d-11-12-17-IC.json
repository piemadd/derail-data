THEY THEN SHOVED A CUT INTO EM03 AND THE LAST MOVE WAS TO GO INTO EM04. THE CONDUCTOR PULLED THE CUT HIGH TO SHOVE EM02 AND INADVERTENTLY LINED THE EM10 SWITCH AGAINST HIMSELF AFTER LINING EM02 NORMAL. WHEN HE SHOVED HIS CUT OF CARS FOR EM03 HE TRAILED THROUGH THE EM10 SWITCH THAT WAS LINED AGAINST HIS MOVEMENT. AFTER SPOTTING EM03,HE PULLED APPROX. 400' NORTH TO GET OVER THE EM04 SWITCH AND WHEN THEY STARTED SHOVING HE SAW THE CONTAINERS START TO WOBBLE AND STOPPED THE MOVEMENT. THE MOVEMENT CAUSED DTTX 885052 TO TRACK DOWN EM10 WHILE THE OTHER CARS WERE TRACKING DOWN EM08. WHEN THEY SHOVED BACK TOWARDS EM04 THEY DERAILED DTTX 885052 AND DTTX 459190. THE CONDUCTOR WAS TESTED FOR CAUSE, ALL RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. CREW DERAILED A TOTAL OF 8 TUBS ON THE INTERMODAL TRAIN.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"IC941599201711","Report Key":"IC941599201711","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America"}
