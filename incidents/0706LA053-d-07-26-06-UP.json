DISPATCHER GAVE PERMISSION TO MOVE; MOVED 2900 FT AND PULLED HARD.  CREW SAW DUST AND WALKED BACK TODISCOVER DERAILED ARTICULATED CARS.  SO99 -  ON JULY 26, 2006 AT CONTROL POINT (CP) SP697, M.P. 697.04, ON THE YUMA SUBDIVISION NEAR GLAMIS, CA., THE EASTBOUND IGSAT 24 REPORTED THAT THE ABSOLUTE SIGNAL AT THE CP DROPPED RED IN THE FACE OF THE TRAIN.  AFTER STOPPING, WITH THE LOCOMOTIVES PAST THE SIGNAL AT THE CP, AUTHORITY TO PROCEED WAS RECEIVED FROM THE DISPATCHER.  AS THE TRAIN DEPARTED, THE POWER SWITCH MACHINE BECAME UNLOCKED AND THE SWITCH POINTS OPENED UNDER THE 23RD HEAD CAR, DERAILING6 CARS.  AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT TRANSIENT AC VOLTAGES PRESENT ON SEVERAL OF THE SIGNAL CIRCUITS AT THE CP CAUSING ARCING BETWEEN CIRCUITS AND FIRING LIGHTNING ARRESTERS.ONE CIRCUIT EFFECTED WAS THE SWITCH CONTROL CIRCUIT, WHICH APPARENTLY MOVED TO THE REVERSE POSITION.  IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THE WR RELAY BECAME FALSELY ENERGIZED WHEN AN ARC MOMENTARILY PROVIDED A CURRENT PATH BYPASSING THE DETECTOR AND ROUTE LOCKING CONTACTS IN THE CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR THE WR RELAY.  THIS WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE SWITCH MACHINE TO UNLOCK AND MOVE IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION.  SEVERAL POSSIBLE SOURCES FOR THE TRANSIENT AC VOLTAGES WERE REMOVED AND A LOSS OF SHUNT TIMER WAS INSTALLED FOR THE \"OS\" TRACK CIRCUITS.  ALL APPLICABLE TESTS WERE THEN PERFORMED.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"5","Class Code":"1L","Class":"1L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0706LA053200607","Report Key":"UP0706LA053200607","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
