A SECOND CREW CALLED ON THE ELACIZ-22  ARRIVED WITH LIGHT ENGINE AND AFTER TYING UP THEIR POWER, AGREED TO HELP THE FIRST CREW DO THE WORK IN AN EFFORT TOEXPEDITE THEIR MOVES.  AFTER DOUBLING UP TRACK 802 TO 803 FROM THE EAST END, THEN DOUBLING BACK TO TRACK 801 FROM THE EAST END, THE ENGINEER FOR THE IG4CIX BEGAN PULLING EASTWARD ON THE CARS.  WHEN HECOULD NOT GET IT TO MOVE, THE SECOND CREW ON THE ELACIZ VERIFIED HE HAD AIR ALL THE WAY THROUGH THETRAIN.  THE ENGINEER THEN BEGAN TO PULL AGAIN, TELLING THE SECOND CREW THAT HE STILL COULD NOT PULLIT.  THE FIRST CREW BEGAN DRIVING EASTWARD AND FOUND 6 INTERMODAL CARS DERAILED TO THE INSIDE OF THE CURVE ON TRACK 113.

IN ADDITION,THE ENGINEER USED AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF THROTTLE TO BEGIN PULLING THE CARS.  THIS CAUSED A STRINGLINE DERAILMENT OF 6 CARS IN THE CURVED PORTION OF TRACK 113.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP1118LA024201811","Report Key":"UP1118LA024201811","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
