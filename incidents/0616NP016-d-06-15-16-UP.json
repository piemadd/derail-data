THEY PULLED WEST TO THE SWITCH AND CUT AWAY TO GO LIGHT POWER TO LEVEL TO PICKUP 34 CARS.  THE RETURNED TO HAYLAND AND LEFT 34CARS ON THE MAIN AND WENT LIGHT POWER TO PULL 24 CARS THEY LEFT EARLIER.  AFTER MAKING A COUPLING ON24 CARS, THEY BEGAN TO PULL WEST, BUT TO THEIR TRAIN.  THE CREW NOTICED SPARKS WERE COMING FROM THE7TH CAR AND STOPPED.  WHEN THE MOVE STOPPED, CAR TILX516725 WAS WEST OF 701/703.  THE CREW SAW BRAKE RIGGING DRAGGING AND THE CAR WAS ON THE RAIL.  THE CREW SET THE CAR OUT AS A BAD ORDER AND FINISHED PICKING UP THE REST OF THE CARS.  WHEN THE FG WENT TO REPAIR THE BRAKE RIGGING, HE REALIZED THE CAR WAS PREVIOUSLY DERAILED.  UPON INVESTIGATION, THE TILX516725 WAS A PARTIAL LOAD.  THE CUSTOMER INDICATED IT HAD 50 TONS OF DRY FERTILIZER LEFT ON 1 SIDE OF THE CAR.  THIS CAUSED THE CAR TO BE UNBALANCED AND CAUSED THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CAR TO LIFT UP AND THE WEST TRUCK TO DERAIL.
