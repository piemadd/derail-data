CSX ADVISES APPROXIMATELY $5,000 TRACK REPAIRS.  INVESTIGATION RESULTS FROM CSX INDICATES CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT WAS A COMBINATION OF TRACK LAYOUT, TERRAIN, AND BUFF FORCES.  A COMBINATION OF ELEVATION CHANGES COMBINED WITH THE NUMBER OF CROSSOVERS AND TURNOUTS THE TRAIN WAS TRAVERSING, IN ADDITION TO THE BUFF FORCES OF TRAILING TONS CAUSED THE DERAILMENT. THE T.A.P.S. COMMITTEE IS IN AGREEMENT THAT THE CAUSE CODE IS H599.  THE HEAD END OF THE TRAIN WAS ON AN ASCENDING GRADE WITH THE HEAD 26 CARS, AS THE TRAIN PROCEEDED INTO W03.  AS THE ENGINEER SLOWED THE TRAIN THE 27TH CAR WASTRAVELING THRU THE TURNOUT INTO W03, THE TRAILING 46 CARS ARE NOW ON THE DESCENDING GRADE TRAVELINGAT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED.  WHEN THE TRAILING 46 CARS MET WITH THE 27TH CAR THE BUFF FORCES CAUSEDTHE R1 WHEEL ON THE TTGX 991146 TO LIFT OFF THE RAIL IN THE TURNOUT.  THIS IMPACT ROLLED THE NORTH RAIL AT POD AND CAUSED THE 28TH THRU 35TH CAR TO FALL IN BETWEEN THE RAIL UNTIL THE ENGINEER NOTICEDTHE TRAIN WAS NOT TRAVELING NORMALLY.
