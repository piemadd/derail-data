THE RESULTS FOR THE CAUSE WAS AS FOLLOWS. CAR \r\nNW 132509 WAS A MAJOR CAUSE FOR THIS DERAILMENT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. THE CAR IS OVERAGE BUILT 7/1969 WITH NO REBUILD OR EXTENDED LIFE STATUS. THERE IS SEVERE CORROSION THROUGH THE SLOPE SHEET TO THE HOPPER CONNECTIONS, LARGE HOLES CORRODED THROUGH, AT ALL LOCATIONS. THIS EFFECTS THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE LOAD. THERE ARE FRESH WHEEL BURN MARKS ON THE NORTHEND OF THIS CAR INDICATING THAT THE BODY OF THE CAR HAD IN FACT COME IN CONTACT WITH THE WHEELS, WHILE THE CAR WAS IN MOTION. THIS WOULD RESTRICT TRUCK SWIVEL AND CAUSE UNDUE LATERAL STRESS ON THE RAIL HEAD CAUSING THE HIGH SIDE RAIL IN THE CURVE TO ROLL OUT. THE NORTH END OF THIS CAR HAS INSUFFICIENT SIDE BEARING CLEARANCE PER AAR INTERCHANGE RULES AGAIN RESTRICTING TRUCK SWIVEL. IN ADDITION ITWAS DISCOVERED DURING THE INVESTIGATION THAT NUMEROUS CARS IN THIS TRAIN WERE LOADED IMPROPERLY. THECARS WERE LOADED HEAVY ON THE NORTH END AND LITE ON THE SOUTH END. THIS WAS ALSO IN OUR INVESTIGATION ON 11/23/09 BY FRA INSPECTOR MATT RAYLINSKY.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"GRS302200911","Report Key":"GRS302200911","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 2","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"GRS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Pan Am Railways/Guilford System","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 2","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"GRS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Pan Am Railways/Guilford System","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
