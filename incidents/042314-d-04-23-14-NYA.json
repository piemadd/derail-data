AS A RESULT, DAMAGE TO LIRR PROPERTY WAS SUSTAINED AT THE STATION. \r\n\r\nTHE CAR WAS THE 26TH CAR IN A 41 CARCONSIST. THE CREW WAS UNAWARE OF ANY OF ANY IMPACT OR EVENT PRIOR TO BEING INSTRUCTED BY LIRR TO STOP THEIR TRAIN AND INSPECT THE CONSIST DUE TO THE STATION PLATFORM STRIKE AT WYANDANCH.\r\n\r\nTHE ENGINEER AND CREW PERFORMED AN INITIAL TERMINAL BRAKE TEST PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM THE POINT OF ORIGIN. DURING THE INSPECT OF BOTH SIDES OF THE CONSIST NEITHER THE CONDUCTOR NOR THE BRAKEMAN TOOK ANY EXCEPTION TO THE TRAIN AND BOTH CREWMEMBERS FAILED TO NOTICE THAT THE PLUG DOOR WAS NOT SECURELY CLOSED AND THAT THE TRAIN WAS NOT SAFE TO MOVE.\r\n\r\nTHE CAR IN QUESTION HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE CUSTOMER SIDING THE PRIOR NIGHT AND HAD BEEN MOVED SAFELY FROM HOLTSVILLE TO PINEAIRE. IT APPEARS THAT THE DOOR MAY HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH AND OPENED BY TRESSPASSERS DURING THE 18 HOURS THAT THE CAR SAT IN THE PILGRIM SPUR SIDING AT PINE AIRE. THIS LOCATION IS VERY ACCESSIBLE FROM THE ADJACENT PARKING LOT. AFTERINSPECTION OF THAT AREA, THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT TRESPASSERS HAD BEEN IN THE AREA RECENTLY.\r\n\r\n**TRACK AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA REVISED 09/30/2014 TO MATCH LIRR EQ20140402**\r\n\r\n09/10/15 - DAMAGE COST FINALIZED","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"4","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"2","Incident Key":"LIEQ20140402201404","Report Key":"NYA042314201404","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"NYA","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"New York & Atlantic Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Anacostia R","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"LI","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Long Island Rail Road","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
