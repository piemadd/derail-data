AS I WAS APPROACHING FISHERS CROSSING (MI 91367) I TURNED TO CHECK SPEED AND GAUGES WHEN I TURNED BACK I SAW A TRACTOR CROSSING THE TRACKS AT FISHER CROSSING.  I  DUMPED THE AIR AND BLEW THE HORN CONTINUALLY TILL THE TRAIN CAME TO A STOP 312 FEET SOUTH OFTHE CROSSING. WENT BACK TO CHECK PASSENGERS AND THE PERSON IN THE TRACTOR WERE OK.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED VRS EMERGENCY NUMBER DISPATCHER ANSWERED AND STAYED ON THE PHONE WITH ME TILL WE FOUND OUT WHETHER WE NEEDED ANY EMERGENCY PEOPLE OR EQUIPMENT.  NO ONE WAS HURT NOR NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION.  ITHEM CALLED AND THEN THE FARMER CALLED THE STATE POLICE AND FIRE DEPT. WHOM WHERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN 10 MINUTES.  TALKED WITH THE DRIVER OF THE TRACTOR WHO SAID HE DIDN'T SEE US TILL I STARTED TO BLOW THE HORN HE ALSO TOLD THAT HE NAILED THE THROTTLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET ACROSS FASTER.  FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT APPEARED THE TRACTOR MOVED AT A CONSTANT SPEED WHILE CROSSING THE CROSSING.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"VTR895200910","Report Key":"VTR895200910","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"VTR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"VERMONT RAILWAY, INC.","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Vermont Rail Systems","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"VTR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"VERMONT RAILWAY, INC.","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Vermont Rail Systems"}
