THE TRAIN CONSISTED OF 11 LOADED CARS AND TWO LOCOMOTIVES. THE LAST TWO CARS OF THE TRAIN WERE INVOLVED IN THE DERAILMENT. FOLLOWING FRA GUIDELINES, THERE WAS NO REASON TO TEST FOR DRUG OR ALCOHOL INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE WE HAD NO REASONABLE SUSPICION ANDIT WAS NOT GOING TO MEET THER CRITERIA NECESSARY FOR TESTING. WE BELIEVE THE CAUSE FOR THE DERAILMENT WAS WIDE GAUGE DUE TO DETERIORATED TIE CONDITION. THE TRAIN WAS TRAVELING DOWNHILL AND AROUND A CURVE SO THE BRAKES WERE BEING APPLIED. RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE CURVE, THE LAST CAR OF THE TRAIN DROPPEDIN AND TRAVELED ABOUT 150 FEET THEN TRAVELED OUTSIDE THE ROCK BED CAUSING IT TO FLIP AND FLIPPING THE CAR IT WAS COUPLED TO. THIS CAUSED THE TRAIN TO STOP. ALL OTHER CARS REMAINED UPRIGHT AND ON THE RAIL. THERE WAS NO RELEASED OF ANY FUEL OR MATERIAL FROM LOCOMOTIVES OR RAILCARS. THIS TRAIN WAS NOTCARRYING ANY HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. THERE WERE NO OTHER RAILROADS INVOLVED.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"No","Class":"No","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"PICKZ57202103","Report Key":"PICKZ57202103","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"PICK","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"PICKENS RAILWAY CO.","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"PICK","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"PICKENS RAILWAY CO.","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
