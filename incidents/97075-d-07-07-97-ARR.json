THECREW DUMPED 12 CARS WITH THE ENGINEER SHOVING IN REVERSE IN A CLOCKWISE DIRECTION.  THE CREW THEN SHOVED THESE 12 CARS AND THE CABOOSE TO CLEAR THE INNER LOOP SWITCH BY THE DUMP SITE.  THEY THEN PULLED FORWARD, SPOTTED THE LAST CAR OF THAT CUT FOR DUMPING AND LINED THE SWITCH FOR THE INNER LOOP.  THEY DUMPED THE REMAINING CARS WITH THE ENGINEER SHOVING IN REVERSE AROUND THE LOOP.  IT WAS AT THISTIME THAT THE INNER LOOP SWITCH ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE LOOP WAS RUN THROUGH.  UPON COMPLETION OF DUMPING THE ENGINEER WAS INSTRUCTED TO TAKE THEM AHEAD AND ACCORDING TO EVENT RECORDER, MOVED FORWARD 320 FEET BEFORE COMING TO A STOP.  THIS DISTANCE COINCIDES WITH THE LENGTH OF DERAILMENT CARS.  CONDUCTOR IS TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS DERAILMENT.  HE CONCEDED THAT HE DID NOT RIDE THE POINTAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN POSITION TO LINE THE SWITCH WHICH WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE CARS FROM DERAILING.  ADMITTEDLY, HE WAS IN THE DUMPSHACK AND OUT OF POSITION.  HE IS IN VIOLATION OF GCOR RULE 8.2 POSITION OF SWITCHES AND 8.15 SWITCHES RUN THROUGH.
