WHILE SHOVING BACK TO THE REAR PORTION OF THEIR TRAIN, THE ENGINEER WAS TRAVELING AT 1.2MILES PER HOUR AND SET FIRST SERVICE ON THE TRAIN 27 SECONDS BEFORE THE TRAIN MADE A COUPLING (23 FEET), BEFORE SETTING FULL INDEPENDENT BRAKE, CAUSING THE 4 LOCOMOTIVES ON THE HEADEND AND THE MID DPU TO STOP.  THE TRAILING TONNAGE WAS 16739 TONS AND 243 CARS WITH A MID 118 CARS FROM THE HEADED.  THE ENGINEER WAS IN DYNAMIC BRAKING WHILE COMPLETING THE MOVE, \r\n FEATHERING THE THROTTLE TO CONTROLSPEED.  THE TIME AND DISTANCE OF THE FIRST SERVICE SET TO THE COUPLING WAS TOO SHORT AND THE AIR HADNOT HAD TIME TO SET COMPLETELY, CAUSING SEVERE SLACK ACTION TO THE ETRX850421 EMPTY COAL CAR CAUSING IT TO LIFT OFF THE RAIL AND SHOVE TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE CURVE AND LAND ON THE GROUND 18 FEET OF DISTANCE.  THIS WAS FAR ENOUGH AHEAD OF THE CONDUCTOR'S POSITION TO SEE.  THE CONDUCTOR THEN DROVE TOTHE HEADEND OF THE TRAIN AND THEY DEPARTED.  THE TRAIN TRAVELED 1080 FEET UNTIL IT WENT INTO EMERGENCY.","Joint Track Type":"Siding","Joint Track Class":"4","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP1021HL031202110","Report Key":"UP1021HL031202110","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
