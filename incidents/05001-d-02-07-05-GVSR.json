HE GOT OFF THE TRAIN AND ALIGNEDTHE CROSSOVER SWITCHES AND THE VALLEY YARD LEAD SWITCH AS WAS NECESSARY.  HE GOT BACK ON THE TRAINAND CONTINUED WITH THE SHOVE.  AFTER MOVING ABOUT 24 - 28 CAR LENGTHS THE ENGINEER FEELS SOME JERKING AND STOPS THE TRAIN.  THE SWITCHMAN WALKS ALONG THE TRAIN AND FINDS CARS HAVE DERAILED.  THE LOCATION OF THE DERAILED WHEELS ON THE LAST CAR DERAIL, BNSF 478091, WERE BETWEEN THE HEEL BLOCK AND THEFROG ON THE EAST YARD LEAD (TRACK 6192) SWITCH ON THE 6199/6192 CROSSOVER.  THIS TURNOUT IS 90# RAILWHILE ALL OF THE OTHER TRACK AND TURNOUTS IN THE AREA ARE 115# OR HEAVIER.  THE TIES WERE IN POOR CONDITION WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF PUMPING.  A LARGE NUMBER OF SPIKES HAD WORKED TOTALLY OUT OFTHE TIES.  GVSR UNDERSTANDS THAT BNSF HAS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT WAS H704 - SWITCH PREVIOUSLY RUN THROUGH.  BNSF TAKES THE POSITION THAT THE SWITCH THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY RUN THROUGH WAS THE VALLEY LEAD SWITCH.  THIS SWITCH POINT IS SOME 140 FEET AWAY FROM THE POINTOF DERAILMENT.  TWENTY TWO WHEELS OF 286,000 POUND CARS HAD MOVED THROUGH THE SWITCH ON THE GROUND.THE MOVEMENT WAS TRAILING THE POINTS ON THIS SWITCH AND THE CARS WERE MOVING STRAIGHT THROUGH THESWITCH.
