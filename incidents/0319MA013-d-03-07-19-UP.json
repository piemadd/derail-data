BECAUSE THE DAMAGE TO THE SWITCH RAILS OCCURRED THROUGHOUT ITS LENGTH, AND PRIOR TO THE FRACTURED WELD (WHICH WAS LOCATED PAST THE SWITCH), IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THE FRACTURED WELD CAUSED THE DERAILLMENT.  FURTHERMORE, A LACK OF IMPACT MARKS ON THE WHEELS FURTHER INDICATES THE FOUR CARS PRIOR TO THE FIRST DERAILED CAR DID NOT ENCOUNTER A BROKEN RAIL.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE CARS WERE INSPECTED SO LONG AFTER THE DERAILMENT, IT ISPOSSIBLE THAT ANY MARKS COULD HAVE BEEN WORN FROM THE WHEELS DURING THAT TIME.  THE DAMAGE TO THE SWITCH RAILS FURTHER INDICATES A CAR DERAILED PRIOR TO THE SWITCH, WHILE ON THE INDUSTRIAL LEAD.  BASED ON THE EVIDENCE SUBMITTED TO DATE, THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT IS INCONCLUSIVE.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0319MA013201903","Report Key":"UP0319MA013201903","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
