ATOX BOX TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE TRAIN CREW NRC WAS NOTIFIED REPORT #1327486. UPON REVIEW OF THE BRIDGE BY PURDUE UNIVERSITY STRUCTURAL EXPERT ROB CONOR, IAN ELLIOT, AND KYLE BAKER IT WAS DETERMINEDTHAT THE MOST PLAUSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE COLLAPSE IS A FAILURE OF FLOORBEAM 3 AT PANEL POINT L3 ON THENORTH TRUSS DUE TO THE PROPAGATION OF SHEAR CRACKING THROUGH THE WEB. THE BOTTOM COPED DETAILS OF THE FLOORBEAM CREATE A STRESS RISER AT THE POINT AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL PLANES OF THE WEB. THIS RISER IS SUBJECTED TO STRESS REVERSAL AND IS PRONE TO DEVELOPING FATIGUE CRACKING. IT IS POSTULATED THAT THE CRACK BEGAN IN THE WEB OF THE FLOORBEAM NEAR THE END AND TRAVELLED ALONG THE CROSSHATCHED SECTION. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PROCEEDING WHEELSET ON THE FIRST ROLLED OVER RAILCAR, NOKL 823561, SHEARED THROUGH THE WEB AND THE FLOORBEAM WAS LEFT ATTACHED ONLY BY THE CONNECTION ANGLES AT THE STRINGER LOCATIONS. THE SUBSEQUENT WHEELSET OF NOKL 82561 THEN TRAVELLING OVER THISBROKEN SECTION WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY PULLED THE STRINGERS FROM THEIR CONNECTION ANGLES RESULTING INA COLLAPSE OF THE REMAINING FLOOR SYSTEM AND A ROLLING ONTO THE NORTH TRUSS.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"RCPERCP991122D202201","Report Key":"RCPERCP991122D202201","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 2","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"RCPE","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Rapid City, Pierre & Eastern Railroad, Inc.","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Genesee & Wyoming","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 2","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"RCPE","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Rapid City, Pierre & Eastern Railroad, Inc.","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Genesee & Wyoming"}
