APPROXIMATELY 80 CARS PASSED THE CONDUCTOR BEFORE THE TRAIN CAME TO A STOP AND THE ENGINEER REQUESTED VIA RADIO FOR THE CONDUCTOR TO PROCEED TO THE HEAD END. AT THIS POINT, CARS WERE ON THE GROUND. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE 5TH CAR (TILX51092) AND 6TH CAR (CITX 680565) LEFT THE TRACK ABRUPTLY TO THE NORTH AS EVIDENCED BY SHORT MARKS ONTHE NORTH-SIDE RAIL WITH NO ACCOMPANYING MARKS ON THE SOUTH-SIDE RAIL OR INSIDE THE GAUGE.  DURINGTHE DERAILMENT-CAUSE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE 5TH AND 6TH CARS LOST CONTACT WITH THE RAIL DUE TO AN EXCESSIVE WIND GUST FROM A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION, STRIKING THE EMPTY TRAIN IN A PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION.  THE DEPARTURE OF THE 5TH AND 6TH CARS PULLED LINES 3, 4 AND 7 OFF OF THE RAIL AS A RESULT, CAUSING THESE CARS TO BECOME DERAILED AS WELL. LOCAL AND SURROUNDING WEATHER REPORTS, AS WELL AS FURTHER  DATA COLLECTED AND REVIEWED, REVEALED THAT WIND GUSTS EXCEEDED 60 MPH, WHICH ALSO CAUSED OTHER DAMAGE IN NEARBY AREAS.  REVIEW OF ENGINE RECORDER DATA INDICATED A FORWARD PROGRESSION OF THE DP LOCOMOTIVE ONCE THE INITIAL CARS WERE DERAILED, CAUSED THE 8TH AND 9TH CARS TO ACCORDION UNTIL THE NON-INITIATED EMERGENCY BRAKE APPLICATION BROUGHT THE REAR PORTION OF THE TRAIN TO A STOP.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"IMRRIMR283917D201704","Report Key":"IMRRIMR283917D201704","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 -
