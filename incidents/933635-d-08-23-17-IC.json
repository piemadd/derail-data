THE TRAIN CONSISTED OF VARIOUS ARTICULATED CARS (SINGLES, 3 & 5-PAKS). THEY STOPPED TO OPERATE THE EM07/08 CROSSOVER AND LINED THE EM07 SIDE OF THE CROSSOVER FOR THEIR MOVEMENT BUT FAILED TO LINE THE EM08 SIDE OF THE CROSSOVER. THIS CAUSED THE TRAIN TO RUN THRU THE EM08 SWITCH AND DERAIL CARSDTTX 655461 (SINGLE), BNSF 211393 (3-PAK) AND DTTX 749533 (3-PAK) WHEN THEY MADE A REVERSE MOVE BACK THROUGH THE PREVIOUSLY RUN THRU SWITCH.
