AS THE SEMI'S RUBBER WHEELS WERE LIFTED FROM THE TRACK BY THE HI-RAIL STEEL WHEELS, THE SEMI ROLLED WITHOUT BRAKES DUE TO THE DOWNHILLGRADE AT THIS LOCATION. THE HI-RAIL SEMI IS DESIGNED TO USE THE SEMI'S RUBBER WHEELS AND BRAKE SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE BRAKING. AS THE HI-RAIL STEEL WHEELS LIFTED, THE SEMI'S RUBBER WHEELS LOST CONTACT WITH THE TRACK, AND AS A RESULT ROLLED, UNATTENDED APPROXIMATELY 2.8 MILES, JUMPING TWO DERAILS POSITIONED OPPOSITE THE HI-RAILS MOVEMENT, WITHOUT DERAILING. THE HI-RAIL SEMI COLLIDED WITH A SECOND UNOCCCUPIED HI-RAIL VEHICLE THAT WAS ON THE TRACK.  THE HI-RAIL STEEL WHEEL ASSEMPLY LACKS ANY FORM OF MECHANICAL, ELECTICAL, PNUEMATIC OR AIR SUPPLIED BRAKES SYSTEMS, RELYING SOLELY ON THE SEMI'S BRAKINGSYSTEM. THE HI-RAIL OPERATOR LACKED PROPER TRAINING AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE SEMI'S BRAKING SYSTEM.THE PORTABLE DERAILS WERE IMPROPERLY POSITIONED TO PROTECT THE AFFECTED WORK ZONES. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE TRACK OR SIGNAL SYSTEMS.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"No","Class":"No","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UTAX08242010201008","Report Key":"UTAX08242010201008","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 - Commuter West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UTAX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Utah Transit Authority","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 - Commuter West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UTAX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Utah Transit Authority","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
