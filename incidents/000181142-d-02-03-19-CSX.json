THE YARDMASTER THEN GAVE THE Y39002 PERMISSION TO PROCEED WEST USING 6 YARD LEAD. THE Q56102 MOVING WEST TRAVELED PAST THE HAND THROWN SWITCH TOWARDS 5 YARD LEAD AND REALIZES THAT THE POWER SWITCH CONTROLLED BY THE YARDMASTER IS AGAINST HIM AND STOPS IN THE FOUL OF 6 YARD LEAD.  THE LEAD LOCOMOTIVE OF THE Y39002 THEN COLLIDES WITH THE Q56102 LEAD ENGINE DERAILING BOTH UNITS OF THE Q56102. BOTH UNITS OF THE Y39002 AS WELL AS THE FIRST CAR IN THE Y39002 CUT ALSO DERAILED.  RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION INDICATE THAT THE YARDMASTER FAILED TO COMMUNICATE THE PROPER ROUTING FOR MOVEMENT TO THEQ56102. THE YARDMASTER CONTROLS THE ELECTRIC SWITCHES AND HAD THE SWITCH IMPROPERLY LINED TOWARDS 6YARD LEAD.  THE YARDMASTER BELIEVED THE Q56102 WAS LINED TOWARDS 5 YARD LEAD BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THEQ56102 WAS ON A DIFFERENT TRACK WHEN HE GAVE Q561 PERMISSION OUT TOWARDS 5 YARD LEAD.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"3","Incident Key":"CSX000181142201902","Report Key":"CSX000181142201902","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation"}
