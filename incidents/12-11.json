THE CONDUCTOR LINED THE SOUTH 53 CROSSOVER SWITCH FOR OTHER THAN CROSSOVER MOVEMENT AND LEFT THE NORTH 53 CROSSOVER SWITCH LINED FOR CROSSOVER MOVEMENT. THE CONDUCTOR DID THIS BECAUSE JOB 7 WAS PULLING OUT OF 810 FROM THE SOUTH END AS SOON AS THEY CLEARED UP AND ASSUMED THAT JOB 7 WAS GOING TO USE THE SAME CROSSOVER SWITCH. ONCE JOB 9 CLEARED UP, JOB 7 PULLED 810 FROM THE SOUTH END. THE CONDUCTOR USED THE 52 CROSSOVER INTO THE 201 LEAD, INSTEAD OF USING THE 202 LEAD AND THEN SHOVING THROUGH THE 53 CROSSOVER FOR THE SHOVING MOVEMENT. ONCE JOB 7 CLEARED UP PAST THE52 CROSSOVER SWITCH, THE CONDUCTOR LINED BOTH 52 CROSSOVER SWITCHES FOR OTHER THAN CROSSOVER MOVEMENT. THE CONDUCTOR GOT INTO POSITION TO WATCH THE SHOVE INTO TRACK 405. THE CONDUCTOR FAILED TO VERIFY HIS LINE-UP AND NEVER LINED THE NORTH 53 CROSSOVER SWITCH FOR OTHER THAN CROSSOVER MOVEMENT.
