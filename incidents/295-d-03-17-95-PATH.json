GUNNELL (#5405) WAS INVOLVED IN A SWITCHING COLLISION AT HCMF. MR. GUNNELL WAS TO OPERATE A THREE CAR TRAIN (882-108-847) FROM SIGNAL #106X TO TRK #14 BETWEEN SIGNAL RK-140X AND R200X FOR STORAGE. THERE WAS A LIGHT RAIN WHICH CAUSED THE RAILS TO BEWET. MR. GUNNELL (OPERATING FROM CAR #882) STATED IN HIS REPORT THAT AFTER ENTERING TRK #14 HE BEGAN APPLYING HIS BRAKES. HE THEN REALIZED THE TRAIN WAS NOT BRAKING PROPERLY. THE TRAIN WENT THROUGH THE TRIPPER AND STRUCK THE BAY DOOR TO THE MAINTENANCE BUILDING CAUSING DAMAGE OF APPROX $14,700. ANINVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT SHOWED TWO CARS HAD THE BRAKES CUT-OUT (108-847). THE DISTANCE BETWEENSIGNAL RK-140X AND R200X WAS MEASURED TO BE 240 FT. THE DISTANCE FROM SIGNAL R200X TO THE BAY DOOROF THE MAINTENANCE BUILDING IS 36 FT; FOR A TOTAL DISTANCE OF 276 FT. A TEST WAS CONDUCTED ON 3/29/95 ON TRK #28 WITH THREE CARS (657-172-649). THE TEST RESULTS INDICATE THAT WET RAIL AND TWO CAR BRAKES CUT OUT WILL INCREASE THE BRAKING DISTANCE BEFORE A THREE CAR TRAIN WILL COME TO A STOP (E04C). THIS IS A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE. THE PRIMARY CAUSE IS HUMAN FACTOR (H599).NoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"PATH295199503","Report Key":"PATH295199503","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"PATH","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Port Authority Trans Hudson","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"PATH","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Port Authority Trans Hudson","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
