CORNERING OCCURRED DURING HUMPING OPERATION AT BENSENVILLE YARD.UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN WHICH ASSIGNMENT OR CREW MEMBERS WERE INVOLVED AND THE ACTUAL CONSIST AT TIME OFCORNERING.  ON JANUARY 9, 2002 A CROSS FUNCTIONAL MEETING WAS HELD WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF SIGNALSAND COMMUNICATION, ENGINEERING SERVICES, AND FIELD OPERATIONS.  DURING THIS MEETING CONDITIONS OF PRO YARDS OPERATION WAS DISCUSSED.  THE FOLLOWING WERE DECIDED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN.  IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT A \"HOT ZONE\" EXISTS 200 FEETFROM THE CLEARANCE POINT ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE TRACKS IN THE CLASSIFICATION YARD.  NO CAR SHOULD BEHUMPED INTO THIS HOT ZONE WHEN IT IS OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER CAR.  IT WAS NOTED THAT FOR AN ALARM MESSAGE TO BE SENT BY PRO YARDS, CARS MUST BE STATIONARY IN THIS HOT ZONE.  BY DESIGN, PRO YARDS CIRCUITRY DOES NOT ALWAYS PROTECT AGAINST CARS WHICH MAY FOUL ADJACENT TRACKS.  ONCE THE THIRD AXLE OF A CARPASSES OVER THE SWITCH OCCUPANCY CIRCUITRY ON A TRACK.  PRO YARDS CONSIDERS THIS CAR AS BEING IN THE CLEAR ON THE TARGET TRACK.  IF THE CAR STRIKES ANOTHER CAR IN THE HOT ZONE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE THIRD AXLE PASSES OVER THE SWITCH CIRCUIT AND COMES TO A HALT, THERE IS GREAT EXPOSURE TO A CORNERINGINCIDENT AS A RESULT OF A PORTION OF THE CAR FOULING AN ADJACENT TRACK.
