IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE DERAIL WAS CAUGHT BY SOMETHING HANGING LOW ON A RAIL CAR AND PULLED INTO THE DERAILING POSITION. \r\n\r\nRERAILING COST IS ESTIMATED AT $19,000.\r\n\r\nAMENDED REPORT:\t04/14/2014\r\nQ 38 – CHANGED TO M599\r\nQ 52 - INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT REVEALED THE FOLLOWING:\r\nNO EVIDENCE OF DEFECT OR TAMPERINGTO THE DERAIL OR TRACK. \r\nTHE DERAIL WORKED AS IT IS INTENDED TO.\r\nDURING NORMAL SWITCHING ACTIVITY& WHILE NO CONTRACTORS ARE PRESENT, THE DERAIL IS LOCKED INTO THE OPEN, NON-DERAILING POSITION.THE DERAIL WAS PLACED FOR PROTECTION OF THE CIVIL CONTRACTOR ACTIVITIES WHEN THEY WERE FOULINGTHE TRACKS DURING CONSTRUCTION OF A STREET OVERPASS.\r\nIT WAS DETERMINED THAT SOMETHING CAUGHT THE DERAIL DURING THE TRAIN MOVEMENT.\r\nTHE MECHANICAL AGENT INSPECTING THE RAILCARS WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFYIF ONE OF THE PIECES TORN OFF THE RAILCAR OR IF SOME FOREIGN MATERIAL IS WHAT CAUGHT OR STRUCK THEDERAIL.
