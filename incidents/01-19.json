THE GMRC 263 WAS APPROACHINGTHE CROSSING AT A SPEED OF 20MPH RECORDED BY THE EVENT RECORDER. THE ENGINEER WAS USING THE LOCOMOTIVE HORN IN ACCORDANCE WITH GCOR RULES FOR APPROACHING A HIGHWAY GRADE CROSSING. AS THE TRAIN WAS ONITS FINAL SOUNDING OF THE HORN, THE CONDUCTOR HAD SEEN THE LOG TRUCK APPROACHING THE CROSSING AND YELLED OUT TO THE ENGINEER. THE ENGINEER, NOT ABLE TO SEE THE CONDUCTOR SIDE OF THE CROSSING VERY WELL, DUE TO THE PHYSICAL TERRAIN, HAD NOW NOTICED THE LOG TRUCK ALMOST ON THE CROSSING AND IMMEDIATELYPUT THE TRAIN INTO EMERGENCY. THE VTR 431 HAD MADE CONTACT WITH THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE LOG TRUCK, SPINNING IT AROUND UNTIL THE REAR OF THE LOG TRUCK IMPACTED THE CONDUCTOR SIDE, LONG HOOD OF THE 431. THE BACK OF THE LOG TRUCK CONTINUED SLIDING DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE 431 AND THEN INTO THE NOSE OFTHE GMTX 2684. THESE ACTIONS PUSHED THE LOG TRUCK OFF THE ROAD AND AWAY FROM THE TRACKS FAR ENOUGHTO NOT MAKE CONTACT WITH ANY OTHER PART OF THE TRAIN AS IT CAME TO A STOP APPROXIMATELY 9 RAIL CAR LENGTHS FROM THE CROSSING.
