TWO OF THE DERAILED CARS WERE LEANING AGAINST AN EMPTY COAL TRAIN, C73891-02, STANDING ON THE INSIDE LOOP DERAILING CITX 601545 AND CEFX 600527 AND DAMAGING GBRX 49032 AND MECX 1088. INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT FOUND THAT THE POINT OF DERAILMENT WAS THE OUTSIDE LOOP SWITCH ON THE SOUTH CROSSOVER. THE SWITCH WAS LINED FOR MOVEMENT ON THE OUTSIDE LOOP HOWEVER THE SWITCH HOOK WAS PLACED IN THE LATCH IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT HELD THE LATCH IN THE UNLOCKED POSITION ALLOWING THE SWITCH POINTS TO OPEN UNDER MOVEMENT. CMT EMPLOYEES WERE THE LAST ONES HANDLING THE SWITCH CAUSING THE DERAILMENT.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"XCVTINDUSTRY201802","Report Key":"IC949113201802","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shippers","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"XCVT","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CONVENT MARINE TERMINAL","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
