AFTER SPOTTING TRACK 20 THE HELPER LINED THE SWITCH FOR TRACK 21 AND DIRECTED THE ENGINEER TO BEGIN SHOVING SOUTH. THE FOREMAN TOOK OVER THE SHOVE AT THAT POINT AS HE WAS POSITIONED AT THE SPOT. AFTER TRAVELLING APPROXIMATELY 620 FEET THE TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY. AT THE SAME TIME THE HELPER NOTICED SPARKS COMING FROM CARS AND TRACK AND INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER TO STOP. BEFORE THE TRAIN COULD COME TO A COMPLETE STOP THREE CARS DERAILED AND ROLLED ONTO THEIR SIDE. THE RAIL CARS THAT ROLLED OVER SUSTAINED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE. THE APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET OF RAIL WAS DAMAGED AND A SWITCH ON THE ADJACENT TRACK WAS DAMAGED FROM THE CARS ROLLING OVER. INVESTIGATION FOUND WEAK TIE CONDITIONS IN THE CURVE ALLOWED THE GAUGE TO SPREAD AND CAUSE THE DERAILMENT.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"XCAIINDUSTRY201601","Report Key":"PTRA2016000005201601","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Switching and Terminal","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"PTRA","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Port Terminal Railroad Association","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shippers","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"XCAI","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CARGILL, INC","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
