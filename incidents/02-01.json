DERAILEDCARS CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO  RETARDERS.  CAUSE DETERMINED TO BE  ICE AND SNOW ON TRACK AND IN FLANGEWAY.  BRIEF DESCRIPTION: AN EMPTY BOX CAR DERAILED ON A CROSSING THAT IS USED TO MAINTAIN THE HUMP YARD SWITCHES AND RETARDERS AT THE ST PAUL HUMP. THE CAR DID EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE 2ND GROUP RETARDER BRAKING CYLINDERS AND THE CONTROL UNIT WAS DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR.    FINAL CAUSE:  ICE AND SNOW BUILD UP ON THE MAINTENANCE CROSSING.  ROOT CAUSE OF INCIDENT:  THE ACCUMULATION OF SEVERAL EVENTS LEAD TO THE BUILD UP OF ICE AND SNOW ON THE CROSSING. THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE VERY POOR. THEREWAS A BUILD UP OF ICE DUE TO FREEZING RAIN AND ON TOP OF THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL INCHES OF HEAVY WET SNOW. THERE WERE TWO POWER OUTAGES DURING THE DAY.  DURING THE POWER OUTAGES THE HUMP WAS OUT OF SERVICE.  THE NORMAL HUMPING OPERATION USUALLY KEEPS THE MAINTENANCE CROSSING FREE OF ICE AND SNOW.THERE WAS ALSO VEHICLE TRAFFIC OVER THE MAINTENANCE CROSSING THAT FURTHER COMPACTED THE ICE AND SNOW. THE FIRST CAR THAT WAS HUMPED WAS AN EMPTY CAR.  RECOMMENDED CORRECTIVE ACTION #1:  SECTION CREW TO MAINTAIN AND KEEP ALL CROSSINGS FREE OF ICE AND SNOW.
