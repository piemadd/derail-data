THE CREW SHOVED FOR 1.1 MILES.DURING THE SHOVE, THE DERAILMENT INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT A SWITCH WAS LINED AGAINST THE TRAIN, ANDTHE CONDUCTOR DID NOT LINE THE SWITCH.  THIS CREW CAME TO A STOP AND CUT THE DPU UNITS OFF, AND CUTTHEM INTO THE HEAD END OF THE TRAIN.  A RELIEF CREW GOT ON THE TRAIN AND STARTED PULLING EAST.  SINCE THE SWITCH HAD BEEN RUN THROUGH, THE CARS TRAVERSED TOWARD THE WAY THE SWITCH WAS LINED WHICH CAUSED THE CARS TO TRAVEL DOWN THE WRONG TRACK THAT THE REST OF THE TRAIN WAS ON.
