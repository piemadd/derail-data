THE YARDMASTER THEN GAVE THE Y39002 PERMISSION TO PROCEED WEST USING 6 YARD LEAD. THE Q56102 MOVING WEST TRAVELED PAST THE HAND THROWN SWITCH TOWARDS 5 YARD LEAD AND REALIZES THAT THE POWER SWITCH CONTROLLED BY THE YARDMASTER IS AGAINST HIM AND STOPS IN THE FOUL OF 6 YARD LEAD.  THE LEAD LOCOMOTIVE OF THE Y39002 THEN COLLIDES WITH THE Q56102 LEAD ENGINE DERAILING BOTH UNITS OF THE Q56102. BOTH UNITS OF THE Y39002 AS WELL AS THE FIRST CAR IN THE Y39002 CUT ALSO DERAILED.  RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION INDICATE THAT THE YARDMASTER FAILED TO COMMUNICATE THE PROPER ROUTING FOR MOVEMENT TO THEQ56102. THE YARDMASTER CONTROLS THE ELECTRIC SWITCHES AND HAD THE SWITCH IMPROPERLY LINED TOWARDS 6YARD LEAD.  THE YARDMASTER BELIEVED THE Q56102 WAS LINED TOWARDS 5 YARD LEAD BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THEQ56102 WAS ON A DIFFERENT TRACK WHEN HE GAVE Q561 PERMISSION OUT TOWARDS 5 YARD LEAD.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"3","Incident Key":"CSX000181142201902","Report Key":"CSX000181142201902","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 -

THE CONDUCTOR HAD DISMOUNTED FROM THE TRAIN IN ORDER TO MAKE A CUT ON THE REAR PORTION OF THE TRAIN.  AS THE MOVE PROGRESSED, THE ENGINEER WAS HAVING TROUBLE IDENTIFYING THE POSITION OF THE SWITCH POINTS / SWITCH TARGETS AND IN ADDITION, THERE WAS AN “OFF TRACK” END-LOADER CLEARING SNOW FROM NEXT TO THE TRACKS. ONCE CLOSE ENOUGHTO SEE THE SWITCHES HE SAW THAT THE ROUTE WAS IN FACT LINED FOR HIS MOVEMENT. \r\nAT THIS MOMENT, THEENGINEER ALSO NOTICED THAT THE HEAD CAR ON THE MAIN TRACK WAS FOULING THE LEAD. HE APPLIED AN EMERGENCY BRAKE APPLICATION; HOWEVER, HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP SHORT OF THE FOULING CAR, WHEREIN THE LOCOMOTIVES SIDESWIPED THE CAR, CAUSING LADDER AND HANDHOLD SAFETY APPLIANCES TO THE CAR AND THREE LOCOMOTIVES. \r\nUPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION AS TO HOW AND WHY THE CAR WAS LEFT OUT TO FOUL, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT MANAGER HAD EARLIER INSTRUCTED A CREW TO LEAVE THE CAR AS ITWAS POSITIONED, WITH THE INTENT OF HAVING THE ABOVE MENTIONED INBOUND TRAIN CREW STOP AND PLACE THECAR INTO THE CLEAR.
