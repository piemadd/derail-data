WALLINGFORD. AT APPROX. 920 THE GMRC 263 WITHLOCOMOTIVES VTR 431, GMTX 2684 AND THE VTR 202 WITH 24 LOADED SLURRY CARS WAS HEADING EAST (TINE TABLE DIRECTION) APPROACHING ROUTE 140 (MP B39.49) DOT CROSSING 859-878G. THE GMRC 263 WAS APPROACHINGTHE CROSSING AT A SPEED OF 20MPH RECORDED BY THE EVENT RECORDER. THE ENGINEER WAS USING THE LOCOMOTIVE HORN IN ACCORDANCE WITH GCOR RULES FOR APPROACHING A HIGHWAY GRADE CROSSING. AS THE TRAIN WAS ONITS FINAL SOUNDING OF THE HORN, THE CONDUCTOR HAD SEEN THE LOG TRUCK APPROACHING THE CROSSING AND YELLED OUT TO THE ENGINEER. THE ENGINEER, NOT ABLE TO SEE THE CONDUCTOR SIDE OF THE CROSSING VERY WELL, DUE TO THE PHYSICAL TERRAIN, HAD NOW NOTICED THE LOG TRUCK ALMOST ON THE CROSSING AND IMMEDIATELYPUT THE TRAIN INTO EMERGENCY. THE VTR 431 HAD MADE CONTACT WITH THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE LOG TRUCK, SPINNING IT AROUND UNTIL THE REAR OF THE LOG TRUCK IMPACTED THE CONDUCTOR SIDE, LONG HOOD OF THE 431. THE BACK OF THE LOG TRUCK CONTINUED SLIDING DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE 431 AND THEN INTO THE NOSE OFTHE GMTX 2684. THESE ACTIONS PUSHED THE LOG TRUCK OFF THE ROAD AND AWAY FROM THE TRACKS FAR ENOUGHTO NOT MAKE CONTACT WITH ANY OTHER PART OF THE TRAIN AS IT CAME TO A STOP APPROXIMATELY 9 RAIL CAR LENGTHS FROM THE CROSSING. WEATHER WAS ABOUT 20F AND CLOUDY AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"VTR1482201901","Report Key":"VTR1482201901","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"VTR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"VERMONT RAILWAY, INC.","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Vermont Rail Systems","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"VTR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"VERMONT RAILWAY, INC.","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Vermont Rail Systems"}
