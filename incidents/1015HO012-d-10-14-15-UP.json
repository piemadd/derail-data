WHILE THESE LOADED CARS WERE ROLLING INTO BOWL TRACK 9, THE CONTINUED EFFECT OF MULTIPLE CUTS ROLLING INTO FREE STANDING CARS CAUSED THE ENTIRE TRACK TO ROLL SOUTHWARD, EVENTUALLY FOULING THE LEAD ON THE SOUTH END, COMING TO REST UP AGAINST THE YHO11R-14, THAT WAS DRAGGED OUT ON THELEAD, HANGING OUT OF BOWL TRACK 4.  SIX TOTAL CARS DERAILED AS THE RESULT OF THE SIDESWIPE OF TRACK9 INTO THE SIDE OF THE CARS ON THE LEAD.  AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INCLUDING MULTIPLE RE-ENACTMENTS, NO HUMAN OR CREW INVOLVEMENT WAS FOUND, NO SITE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING HUMPING CARSOR SPEED OF CUTS WERE VIOLATED, NO MECHANICAL OR TRACK ISSUES WERE PRESENT TO CAUSE THE CARS TO ROLL INTO THE CARS ON THE LEAD.  THERE WERE MULTIPLE AUTO RACK CARS IN BOWL TRACK 9 WHICH MOST LIKELY AIDED THE SPRING EFFECT EACH TIME THE CUTS OF CARS COUPLED IN ON THE NORTH END OF THE CUT OF CARS, WHICH FURTHER INCREASED THE FORCES PUSHING AGAINST THE TWO HAND BRAKES ON THE SOUTH END OF THE TRACK.DURING THE RE-ENACTMENTS, CARS STILL ROLLED EVEN WITH 4 HANDBRAKES ON THE TRACK.  IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THE LOADS HUMPED INTO BOWL TRACK 9 DID NOT CATCH UP TO ONE ANOTHER.  CAUSE OF INVESTIGATION ISAN OBSTRUCTION OF TRACK 9 FOULING THE LEAD.
