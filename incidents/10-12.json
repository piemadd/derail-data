CSX ROADMASTER INVESTIGATED THE SCENE, ALONG WITH BN ROADMASTER AND DETERMINED THE POINT OF DERAILMENT TO BE ON THE BN OWNED AND MAINTAINED PORTION OF THE CONNECTION TRACK. THE WHEEL ACTION AT THE POINT OF DERAILMENT WAS FOUND TO BE A DROP-IN AND CAUSE CODE T110 (WIDE GAGE DUE TO DEFECTIVE TIES) WAS AGREED UPON BY ALL PARTIES. ON 11/29/12, CSX ROADMASTER LEARNED THAT THE CAUSE CODE IN THE BN REPORT AND IN CSXT REPORT WAS SHOWN TO BE T102 (CROSS-LEVEL OF TRACK IRREGULAR NOT AT JOINTS). SINCE THIS WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY AGREED UPON, CSX ROADMASTER CONTACTED THE BN ROADMASTER AGAIN TO RECONFIRM THE FINDINGS THEY AGREED TO ON THE EVENING OF THE DERAILMENT. THE BN ROADMASTER STATED THAT HE HAD RETURNED TO THE LOCATION THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND INVESTIGATED A LOCATION FURTHER DOWN ON HIS PORTION OF THE CONNECTION TRACK AND DETERMINED THAT THE TRAIN HAD DERAILED IN TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. HE SAID HE THEN RECOMMENDED CHANGING HIS INITIAL T110 CAUSE CODE TO A TRAIN HANDLING CAUSE CODE H599 BASED ON HIS BELIEF THAT THE TRAIN HAD STRING LINED THE CURVE. THIS WAS NOT CONVEYEDTO CSX PRIOR TO NOV. 29TH AND THE CAUSE CODE PROVIDED BY BN TO CSXT TRANSPORTATION OFFICER WAS THE T102 CODE. THIS CAUSE CODE IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TRACK NOTES SUPPLIED BY BN, NOR IS IT SUPPORTED BYCSX ROADMASTERS INVESTIGATION AT THE TIME OF THE DERAILMENT OR HIS SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION ON NOV.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"CSX000110228201210","Report Key":"CSX000110228201210","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 -
