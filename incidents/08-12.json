AFTER PULLING THE ENTIRE TRACK, THE CONDUCTOR SAW THAT THE REAR CAR, XOMX 710363, WAS NOT NEEDED FOR THEIR TRAIN. HE SHOVED THIS CAR NORTH TO THE CLEARANCE POINT ON ALDEN SIDING AND REQUESTED A FULL SERVICE BRAKE APPLICATION AND 3-STEP PROTECTION.  HE APPLIED THE HANDBRAKE ON THE SINGLE CAR AND INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER TO PUSH AGAINST THE CAR IN ORDER TO TEST THE HANDBRAKE. THIS WAS NECESSARY AS THIS LOCATION IS ON A GRADE AND THE LONE HANDBRAKE WOULD NOT HOLD THE ENTIRE TRAIN OF 40 CARS. CONDUCTOR ALLEGEDLY NOTED THAT THE CAR HANDBRAKE WAS EFFECTIVE, STOPPED THE MOVEMENT AND CUT AWAY THE CAR. HE THEN INSTRUCTED THE ENGINEER TO PULL AHEAD TO CLEAR THE CROSS-OVER SWITCH. AS THE ENGINEER BEGAN PULLING AHEAD, THE CONDUCTOR NOTICED THAT THE LONE CAR WAS BEGINNING TO ROLL NORTH DOWN THE GRADE. HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE CAR AS THE HANDBRAKE WAS TIGHT.
