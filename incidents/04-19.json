THE RESULTS OF OUR SITE INSPECTION COMBINED WITH INSPECTION OF THESUB LADLE #29 REVEALED EVIDENCE OF AN IMPROPERLY LOADED CAR. THE CAR WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SOLIDIFIED IRON POOLED TO THE WEST SIDE OF THE CAR RESULTING IMPROPER CLEARANCE OF THE SIDE BEARINGS. THE BEARINGS ON THE WEST ARE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WHILE THE BEARINGS ON THE EAST HAVE CLEARANCE MEASUREMENTS THAT EXCEED THE ALLOWABLE LIMITS BY 1.5”. THIS CONDITION PREVENTED THE CAR FROM ARTICULATING WHILE IN MOTION AND ALLOWING THE R4 WHEEL TO CLIMB THE RAIL.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"DC06201904","Report Key":"DC06201904","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 -
