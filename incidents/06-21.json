WHILE PULLING WEST OUT OF THE BOWL TRACKS, THE GNTX2970 (EMPTY GONDOLA)FAILED TO FOLLOW THE TRACK DUE TO A COMPACTED GRAVEL ROAD CROSSING.  THE WEST AXLE FELL BETWEEN THERAILS AND ONTO THE ROAD ON THE CROSSING NORTH OF THE TRACK.  WHEN THE WEST WHEEL SET IMPACTED THE SWITCH, IT FORCED THE SWITCH TO LINE FOR 601 TRACK.  THIS RESULTED IN DERAILMENT OF TWO CARS.  INVESTIGATION OF TIR'S FROM ALL TRAINS IN THE LOCATION, ALL STATIONARY VIDEO CAMERAS, DOWNLOADS OF RCL MOTORS INVOLVED, AND INTERVIEWS OF CREWS AND MANAGERS WORKING AT THIS LOCATION RESULTED IN DETERMINATION OF ROOT CAUSE M101.  INITIAL INVESTIGATION APPEARED, DUE TO THE POSITION OF THE SWITCH, THAT IT HAD BEEN LINED AGAINST THE MOVE.
