THE JOB 14 CONDUCTOR FAILED TO VERIFY THAT THE EAST 605 SWITCH WAS LINED FOR THE MOVEMENT.

WHEN THE 5 UNIT CONSIST WENT OVER THE PREVIOUSLY RUN THROUGH EAST 605 SWITCH AT A FACING POINT MOVEMENT, THE LEAD 2 UNITS (UPRR 7419, UPRR 4453) DERAILED.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"IMSA80013S002201304","Report Key":"IMSA80013S002201304","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Switching and Terminal","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"IMSA","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Intermodal Services of America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Switching and Terminal","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"IMSA","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Intermodal Services of America","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
