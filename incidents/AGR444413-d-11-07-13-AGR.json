CARS CONTAINED CRUDE OIL.  HAZMAT WAS RELEASED.  THE RAILROAD ISDEVELOPING THE HAZMAT INFORMATION FOR US DOT BUT DOES NOT HAVE THE DETAILS AT THIS TIME.  THE RAILROAD WILL PROVIDE THE HAZMAT INFORMATION FOR THE 25 CARS THAT RELEASED THE CRUDE OIL IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  3/26/14 - RAILROAD ANTICIPATES HAVING ALL THE INFORMATION BY THE END OF APRIL 2014.  THE INVESTIGATION FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT INDICATES ANY TRAIN HANDLING, HUMAN FACTORS OR MECHANICAL ISSUES CAUSED DERAILMENT.
