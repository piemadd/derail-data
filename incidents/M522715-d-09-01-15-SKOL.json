CREW CONDUCTED A JOB BRIEFING TO DISCUSS HOW THEY WOULD USE THE PORT WYE TO GET A SINGLE HAZARDOUS TANK CAR OFF THE HEAD END OF THEIR LOCOMOTIVES TO THE REAR OF THEIR CONSIST.  CREW SHOVED THE SINGLE CAR TO THE SOUTH LEG OFTHE WYE AND CUT AWAY LEAVING THE CONDUCTOR TO SECURE THE CAR AND PREP THE SWITCH ON THE OTHER END FOR THE FINAL MOVEMENT.  IN THE MEANTIME THE UTILITY MAN WALKED TO THE OTHER END OF THE WYE TO LINE THE MAINLINE FOR MOVEMENT.  THE LOCOMOTIVES WORKED THROUGH THE MAINLINE AND ONTO THE NORTH LEG OF THEWYE IN AN EFFORT TO GET AROUND THE SINGLE CAR AND PLACE IT ON THE TAIL OF HIS TRAIN.  AS THE LOCOMOTIVES WAS SHOVING THROUGH SWITCH, THE SINGLE TANK CAR ROLLED BACK INTO THE FOUL AND THE LEADING (UNOCCUPIED) LOCOMOTIVE STRUCK THE TANK CAR MIDWAY DOWN THE SIDE.\r\nINVESTIGATION REVEALED THE CONDUCTORFAILED TO PROPERLY SECURE THE SINGLE CAR WHEN IT WAS CUT OFF AND THE ACTIVITY ON THE ADJACENT TRACKCAUSED IT TO ROLL INTO THE FOUL.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION INDICATED THE ENGINEER FAILED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO ASSURE HE WAS OPERATING HIS LOCOMOTIVE CONSIST FROM THE PROPER LOCOMOTIVE (LEADINGEND) WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO REACT IN COMPLIANCE WITH YARD LIMIT RULES AND STOP WITH HALF THE DISTANCE OF CARS FOULING TRACKS.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SKOLM522715201509","Report Key":"SKOLM522715201509","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"SKOL","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"South Kansas & Oklahoma Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Watco","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"SKOL","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"South Kansas & Oklahoma Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Watco"}
