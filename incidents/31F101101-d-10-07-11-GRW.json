THE FOREMAN MADE THE JOINT ON THE STANDING CARS ON 113H AND FROM HIS VANTAGE POINT THOUGHT THAT THERE WERE ABOUT 18 CARS ON THE TRACK. THE FOREMAN STATED THAT ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT SEE THE END OF THE TRACK HE FELT HE HAD ROOM TO SHOVE IN THE FIVE ADDITIONAL CARS. HE THEN DIRECTED THE ENGINE TO SHOVE FIVE (5) CAR LENGTHS INTO THE TRACK. AFTER SPOTTING THE CARS AND CUTTING THE ENGINE OFF THE CREW WAS PULLING OUT OF THE TRACK AND THE FOREMAN STATED THAT HE THEN SAW THE TRACK FROM A DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINT. HE FELT THERE WERE MORE CARS ON THE TRACK THAN HE INITIALLY THOUGHT. HE THEN DIRECTED HIS CREW TO DELIVER ONE CAR THAT THEY HAD SET OUT FOR THE PLATE MILL WHILE HE WALKED TO THE END OF THE 113H TRACK. IT WAS THEN THAT HE FOUND HE HAD SHOVED OVER THE END OF THE TRACK.
