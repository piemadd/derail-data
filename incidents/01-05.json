AN EMPTY CAR WAS SWITCHED OUT OF THE INDUSTRY AND COUPLED TO THE 8 ON THE MAIN.  THE POWER WENT TO THE GORDONSVILLE SIDING, WEST END AND RECEIVED DISPATCHER PERMISSION TO PUT THE POWER-OPERATED SWITCH INTO HAND OPERATION.  THE CREW PULLED 3 LOADED CARS OUT ON THE MAIN AND PLACED THEM EASTOF THE SWITCH.  THE CREW TESTED THE HAND BRAKES ON THESE CARS WHILE ON THE MAIN.  THEN THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS PLACED INTO THE SIDING AND THE SWITCH LINED FOR THE MAIN.  THE CONDUCTOR, ON THE LEAD CAR, ALLOWED THE CARS TO DRIFT WEST OF THE SIDING SWITCH AND DRAW THE HAND BRAKE TO STOP THE MOTION (THIS ALLOWS THE LOCOMOTIVE TO LINE UP PROPERLY FOR SHOVING CARS INTO THE INDUSTRY).  WHEN THE CONDUCTOR TRIED TO STOP THE CUT, THE FIRST CAR`S (ACFX 58651) HAND BRAKE DID NOT HOLD THE CUT.  THE CONDUCTOR WAS WORKING ON THE SECOND CAR`S HAND BRAKE WHEN HE SAW THAT THE CUT WAS MOVING VERY CLOSE TO THE STANDING CUT ON THE MAIN TRACK.  HE EGRESSED BEFORE THE THREE LOADED CARS IMPACTED THE LEAD EMPTY CAR ONTHE STANDING CUT.  THE IMPACT CAUSED THE CAR (FPAX 980059) TO BUCKLE.

THE REAR CAR THAT TURNED OVER BROKE LOOSE FROM THE TRAIN AND WHILE THE NEXT TWO CARS DERAILED, THEY REMAINED UPRIGHT.  ALL FOURTEEN CARS IN THE TRAIN CONTAINED GRAIN.
