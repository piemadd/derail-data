TRACK 745 HAD 22 CARS AND TRACK 741 HAD 44 CARS TO PULL.  AFTER DOUBLING THE TRAIN, THE CREW COMPLETED THE REQUIRED AIR TEST AND SHOVED OUT OF TRACK 741 NORTH ON THE KAISER LEAD SO THEY COULD DEPART SOUTH TO COLTON.  WHILE SHOVING ONTO THE KAISER LEAD, CARS 12 THROUGH 16 FROM THE HEAD END DERAILED.  CUSTOMER INSTRUCTED CREW TO PULL ALL CARS INCLUDING LINES 14 (PTTX153255) AND LINE 15 (PTTX602349) WHICH WERE NOT RELEASED FROM THE CUSTOMER, BOTH ARE EMPTY FLATS.  WHILE SHOVING THROUGH THE CURVE, EQUIPPED WITH MULTIPLE GAUGE RODS, THE LATERAL FORCE OF THE PTTX602349 (B END) CAUSED THE FLANGE OF THE WHEELS TO CLIMB OFF THE WEST RAIL.  THE MOVE CONTINUED FOR A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 1200 FEET FROM THE POINT OF DERAILMENT.  CSI PLACED THE TWO EMPTY FLAT CARS INTO TRACK 745 BETWEEN 17 LOADS OF STEEL.  ALL OTHER CARS IN TRACK 741 WERE LOADS OF STEEL PIPE AND STEEL COIL EXCEPT FOR ONE EMPTY TANK CAR LOCATED AT THE REAR OF THE TRAIN.  EVENT RECORDER ANALYSIS REVEALED NO TRAIN HANDLING ISSUES BY UP CREW.  MEASUREMENTS BEING TAKEN FOR ACCURATE GRADE PERCENTAGEAND DEGREE OF CURVE AT LOCATION.
