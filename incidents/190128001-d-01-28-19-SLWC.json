AFTER INSPECTION THEY FOUND THAT THEY LEAD SET OF TRUCKS ON THE HEAD CAR OF TRAIN (WAMX 13816) HAD DERAILED. SLWC MANAGEMENT RE-RAILED THE CAR USING RE-RAILERS. THERE ARE NO INJURIES AND NO HAZMATS INVOLVED. AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT DERAILED CAR WAMX 13816 WAS ACTUALLY AN EMPTY CAR THAT WAS NOT ON THE CREWâ€™S PAPERWORK. THE CREW HAD MADE A SET OUT OF THE REAR 21 CARS INTO TINKER LEAD, IN DOING SO THE DYNAMIC FORCES CAUSED THE LEAD SET OF TRUCKS TO LIFT UP OVER THE HIGH SIDE OF THE RAIL DERAILING THE WAMX 13816. THE WAMX 13816 BEING THE ONLY EMPTY CAR IN THE CONSIST LOCATED DIRECTLY AGAINST THE LOCOMOTIVES, COMBINED WITH EMPTY/LOAD RATIO AND POOR TRAIN HANDLING CAUSEDTHE WHEELS TO CLIMB THE RAIL. ONCE CAR WAS DV'D, IT WENT REPORTABLE.","Joint Track Type":"Siding","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SLWC190128001201901","Report Key":"SLWC190128001201901","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"SLWC","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Stillwater Central Railroad Company, LLC","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Watco","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"SLWC","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Stillwater Central Railroad Company, LLC","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Watco"}
