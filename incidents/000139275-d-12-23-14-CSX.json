A MINE EMPLOYEE (1) WENT DOWN TO LINE THEWYE SWITCH ON TRACK 1 FOR MOVEMENT ON THE SOUTH LEG OF THE WYE. INSTEAD, HE LINED THE SWITCH FOR THE NORTH LEG OF THE WYE. JCS TRAIN CREW SUPERVISOR WENT TO GET IN POSITION AND PROTECT THE SHOVING MOVEMENT ON THE SOUTH LEG OF THE WYE TO PREVENT FOULING THE CSX MAIN LINE. EMPLOYEE (1) GAVE THE INSTRUCTION TO SHOVE THE TRAIN BACK. MOVEMENT PROCEEDED ON THE NORTH LEG OF THE WYE TRACK. WITH NO ONE INPLACE TO PROTECT THE SHOVE, JCS CREW SHOVED THROUGH THE SPLIT RAIL DERAIL ON TO THE CSX MAIN LINE SWITCH WHERE THE MOVEMENT PROCEEDED 80 FEET PAST THE SWITCH. THE TRAIN CREW SUPERVISOR HEARD MOVEMENT, BUT NEVER SAW THE BOTTOM OF THE TRAIN TO THE SOUTH LEG OF THE WYE. HE INSTRUCTED THE CREW TO STOPMOVEMENT. THE SUPERVISOR INSPECTED THE SCENE TO FIND 6 CARS PAST THE SPLIT RAIL DERAILER AND DERAILED. JUNCTION CITY MINING DOES NOT USE TRAIN IDS, THE LOCOMOTIVE NUMBER WAS USED.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"4","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"CSX000139275201412","Report Key":"CSX000139275201412","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"Shippers","Other Railroad Class":"Class 3","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"JCMZ","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"JUNCTION CITY MINING","Other Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation"}
