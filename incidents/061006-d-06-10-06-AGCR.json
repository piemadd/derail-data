HE THOUGHT THE SWITCH WAS LINED FOR #2 TRACK WHENIN FACT IT WAS LINED FOR #1 TRACK.  THE TRAIN WAS TO BE PARKED ON #1 TRACK, SO THE SWITCHMAN LINED THE TRACK FOR WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS TRK #1.  IN REALITY HE LINED IT FOR #2 TRK.  WHEN HE REALIZED HIS MISTAKE AND TOLD THE ENGINEER TO BRING THE TRAIN TO A STOP IT WAS TO LATE.  THE LAST CAR STRUCK THE CARS THAT WERE PARKED IN #2 TRK.  THE CARS COLLIDED KNUCKLE TO KNUCKLE AND THERE WAS NO DAMAGE. THE 7MPH IMPACTED DID CAUSE THE DOORS TO COME OPEN ON 2 CARS GCCX680086 AND GCCX680152 WHICH SPILLED MATERIALS ON RAIL.  BOTH ENGINEER AND SWITCHMAN WERE UNAWARE DOORS HAD OPENED, SO WHEN THEY PULLED TRAINOUT  TO PUT IT IN #1 TRK.  THEY DERAILED 7 CARS AND DID NOT KNOW.  THEY THEN SHOVED BACK INTO TRK.#1 AND DERAILED THE 7 CARS EVEN MORE.  THE TRAIN WENT INTO EMERGENCY AT 0945, AND AT 0945 THE DAY SHIFT REPORTED THE DERAILMENT TO SUPERINTENDENT..","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"3","Class":"3","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"AGCR061006200606","Report Key":"AGCR061006200606","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"AGCR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Alamo Gulf Coast Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"AGCR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Alamo Gulf Coast Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
