WHILE SHOVING INTO TRACK 15, SINGLE CAR TTZX866680 DERAILED. THIS SINGLE CAR BEING DERAILED, RESULTED IN THE DERAILMENT OF 7 ADDITIONAL CARS ALONGSIDE MAIN TRACK 2 AT THE WEST END OF EAST YARD. AN M599 OTHER MISCELLANEOUS CAUSES IS BEINGREQUESTED DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTUAL ELEMENTS OF OUR INVESTIGATION. A COMBINATION OF FACTORS ALL CONTRIBUTED TO THE LEADING WHEEL ON THE EMPTY CENTER BEAM FLAT CAR (TTZX 866680) TO ABRUPTLY CLIMB OVER THE HIGH SIDE RAIL. THE SECTION OF TRACK INVOLVED WAS INSPECTED BY THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT ANDALL TRACK MEASUREMENTS ARE WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. INSPECTIONS WERE PERFORMED BY THE MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT ON THE INITIAL CARS INVOLVED IN THE DERAILMENT AND THOSE INSPECTIONS DID NOT REVEAL ANY CONTRIBUTING DEFECTS. MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTORS ARE AS FOLLOWS: HIGH DEGREE OF CURVATURE (13.5-DEGREES)COUPLED WITH NON-CONDEMNABLE GAGE FACE RAIL WEAR AND A DRY (NON-LUBRICATED) RAIL/WHEEL INTERFACE ALLOWED THE VERY LIGHT, LONG AND TOP-HEAVY SET OF (2) EMPTY CENTER BEAM CARS TO LOSE VERTICAL LOADING ALLOWING THE WHEEL TO CLIMB THE RAIL ALONG WITH THE VARIOUS LENGTHS AND TYPES OF CARS IN THE CUT. ASA PREVENTATIVE MEASURE, ENGINEERING WILL ATTEMPT TO REMOVE RISK AT THIS SPECIFIC LOCATION BY IMPLEMENTING 2 MAJOR CHANGES TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FIRST IS WE WILL BE ADDING A GAGE FACE RAIL LUBRICATOR WHICH WILL SUPPLY A FRICTION MODIFIER TO THE HIGH SIDE RAIL FOR BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER LOOP TR","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0822SX009202208","Report Key":"UP0822SX009202208","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
