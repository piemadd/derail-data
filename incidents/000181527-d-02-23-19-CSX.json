CREW PROPERLY KEYED IN THE DTMF TO REVERSE SWITCHAND SPLIT RAIL TO ALLOW THE TRAIN TO EXIT THE PLANT ONTO THE CARTERSVILLE SUB. AS THE TRAIN WAS TRANSITING THROUGH THE CP ONTO THE MAIN, THE CARS FAILED TO CREATE A SHUNT ON THE TRACK DUE TO EXCESSIVEGYPSUM BUILDUP ON THE RAIL AND CAR WHEELS. THIS IN TURN CAUSED THE LOGIC IN THE BUNGALOW TO DETERMINE THAT THERE WAS NO LONGER A TRAIN IN THE OS AND IT BEGAN TO RESTORE THE SPLIT RAIL AND MAIN LINE SWITCH TO NORMAL AS THE TRAIN WAS MOVING THROUGH THE CP. WITH THE SPLIT RAIL NOW REVERSED UNDER THE MOVING TRAIN, LINES 15 THROUGH 24 DERAILED. AT APPROXIMATELY 0300 A LOADED GYPSUM TRAIN HAD DEPARTEDTHE PLANT AFTER A HEAVY RAIN. THIS CAUSED GYPSUM TO DRIZZLE OUT THE BOTTOM DOORS OF THE HOPPERS ANDONTO THE TRACK STRUCTURE. THE E30221 WAS THE NEXT TRAIN TO TRANSIT THIS LOCATION AND ENCOUNTERED THEGYPSUM BUILDUP.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"CL","Class":"CL","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"CSX000181527201902","Report Key":"CSX000181527201902","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-9 - CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CSX","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"CSX Transportation","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"CSX Transportation"}
