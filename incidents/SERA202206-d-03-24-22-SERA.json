THE TRAIN WAS SLOWED DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 5 MPH WHEN THEY ROLLED OVER THE KINK. THE TRACK FURTHER SHIFTED UNDER THE TRAIN AND CAUSED CARS 2-6 TO DERAIL. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THE HEAT KINK WAS RULED TO BE THEPRIMARY REASON FOR THE DERAILMENT, BUT POOR TIE CONDITION AND INCONSISTENT ANCHOR PATTERNS DID NOTPROPERLY LOCK THE RAIL AND TRACK IN PLACE. THE INSUFFICENT SECUREMENT OF THE TRACK STRUCTURE ALLOWEDTHE HEAT KINK TO OCCUR ON THIS WARMER DAY.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"SERASERA202206202203","Report Key":"SERASERA202206202203","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"SERA","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"SIERRA NORTHERN RAILWAY","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"SERA","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"SIERRA NORTHERN RAILWAY","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
