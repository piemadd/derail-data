IN DOING SO, THE CREW TIEDONTO THE TRACK AND PULLED IT OUT UNTIL THEY FOUND THE CAR THEY WERE LOOKING FOR WHICH HAPPENED TO BETHE NORTH CAR THEY HAD A HOLD OF.  THE CAR WAS SET TOWARDS SOUTH-20 & THE BALANCE OF THE CARS THEYDIDN`T NEED WERE SHOVED INTO SOUTH-17.  THE CREW FAILED TO REALIZE THAT THERE WERE (6) MORE CARS INSOUTH-17 AT THE NORTH END THAT APPARENTLY WERE COUPLED TO THE NORTH END OF THE CUT THAT THEY HAD JUST PULLED OUT, WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THE PIN DIDN`T DROP ON THE SOUTH CAR OF THIS SMALLER CUT THE LAST TIME A CREW MADE A JOINT AGAINST IT.  AS A RESULT, WHEN THE CREW PULLED OUT THE CARS THEY HAD AHOLD OF, THE (6) REMAINING CARS IN THE TRACK WERE FREE TO ROLL SOUTH.  THE CREW, NOT REALIZING THIS,BEGAN TO SHOVE THE CAR THEY NEEDED TOWARD SOUTH-20 AND IN THE PROCESS, HAD THE REMAINING  CARS IN SOUTH-17 COLLIDE WITH THE CARS THEY HAD A HOLD OF.  NOTHING DERAILED, HOWEVER, TWO CARS WERE DAMAGED(EJE 90860 AND TIMX 60211).","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"2","Class":"2","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"EJE119F090421200409","Report Key":"EJE119F090421200409","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America"}
