THE CREW REPORTS THAT THEY STOPPED AT THE VALLEY 6207 SWITCH SINCE IT AND THE SWITCHES ON6206, 6205 AND 6204 HAD TO BE ALIGNED FOR THE MOVEMENT INTO THE 6204 TRACK.  THE CARS THAT DERAILEDWERE AT OR PAST THE SWITCH GOING INTO 6204 WHEN THEY STOPPED AND REPORTED CARS ON THE TRACK TO THEYARDMASTER AND ASKED HIM TO PROTECT THE REAR OF THE TRAIN AS THEY BACKED UP.  THE TRAILING WHEELS OFTHE LEAD TRUCK (DURING THE REVERSE MOVEMENT) ON BNSF 473001 HAD A LARGE AMOUNT OF HEAD FLOW, AND ATWO INCH SECTION OF THE HEAD FLOW WAS CHIPPED OUT OF THE WHEEL ON THE FROG SIDE OF THE TRUCK.  THE TWO INCH SECTION OF CHIPPED OUT HEAD FLOW WAS FOUND IN THE FLANGEWAY OF THE FROG WHERE THE DERAILMENTOCCURRED.  THIS SECTION OF THE WHEEL HAD TO HAVE CHIPPED OUT DURING THE REVERSE MOVEMENT, SINCE THIS WHEEL WAS ABOUT THREE TO FOUR FEET SOUTH OF THE FROG DURING THE FORWARD MOVEMENT.  WE BELIEVE IRREGULAR HEAD FLOW OF THE WHEEL WAS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE DERAILMENT.  A DETAILED INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT A WHEEL CLIMBED THE FROG OF THE YARD LEAD EAST TO THE VALLEY YARD FROG JUST AFTER IT PASSED THE POINT OF FROG.  THE FROG WAS ABOUT 3/4\" LOWER THAN THE OPPOSITE RAIL AT THE POINT OF DERAILMENT.
