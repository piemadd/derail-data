THE ENGINEER FOR PF-10 WAS ON THE CSS-2002 IN THE LEAD FACING EAST AND THE CSS-2009 TRAILING. THE CREW WAS COUPLED TO A TRAIN CONSIST OF 17 LOADS AND 0EMPTIES. THE ENGINEER REPORTED TO HIS CREW TO STEP AWAY FROM THEIR TRAIN AS THE LITE ENGINES ROLLINGTOWARDS THEM WERE NOT OCCUPIED AND ABOUT TO COLLIDE WITH THEIR TRAIN. THE ENGINEER DISEMBARKED THECSS-2002 AND STEPPED AWAY MOMENTS BEFORE THE LITE ENGINE CONSIST (2001/2009) COLLIDED WITH THEIR TRAIN. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT WHEN THE ENGINES WERE STAGED BY THE NICTD TERMINAL CAR MEN,NEITHER ENGINE HAD A HAND BRAKE APPLIED RESULTING IN THE ENGINES ROLLING OUT AND COLLIDING WITH THETRAIN. DOWNLOAD REVIEW INDICATES THE CONSIST COLLIDED WITH THE TRAIN OF PF-10 AT 8.4 MPH RESULTING IN EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO BOTH THE 2001 AND 2002.
