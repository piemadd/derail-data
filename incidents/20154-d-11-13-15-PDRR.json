THE DERAILMENT WAS CAUSED WHEN A RAILBROKE UNDER THE TRAIN. THE SPECIFIC RAIL, 100#RA RAIL ROLLED IN 1928, HAD A TRANSVERSE FISSURE DEFECT THAT PROGRESSED THROUGH THE WEB INTO THE BASE. THE TOP OF THE HEAD AND THE BOTTOM OF THE BASE HADNO BROKEN THROUGH. THE SECTION OF THE TRACK HAD BEEN SURFACED A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE DERAILMENT ANDTHE PROCESS OF LIFTING THE RAILS IS BELIEVED TO HAVE CAUSED THE CRACK TO PROGRESS FURTHER. THE RAILSTILL HAD NOT BROKEN THROUGH AT THIS POINT BUT WHEN PT-13 TRAVELED OVER THE SECTION, THE RAIL FLEXED AND BROKE UNDER THE TRAIN. AS THE BREAK WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY A TIE, THE RAIL GAVE WAY UNDER THE 15TH CAR WHERE THE DERAILMENT STARTED. THE ESTIMATED SPEED OF THE TRAIN AT THE TIME OF THE DERAILMENTWAS LESS THAN 10 MPH. THIS WAS DETERMINED BY THE FACT THAT ONLY 80 FEET OF TRACK WAS DAMAGED. AS THE15TH CAR TRAVELED ON THE GROUND, THE LEADING TRUCK TURNED PULLING THE LAST AXLE OF THE 14TH CAR OFFTHE RAIL.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"PDRR20154201511","Report Key":"PDRR20154201511","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"AR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Aberdeen & Rockfish Railroad Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"AR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Aberdeen & Rockfish Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
