OPERATING MANAGER INSPECTED AND FOUND THE 4TH & 5TH CARS HAD BOTH TRUCKS DERAILED AND THE WEST #1 WHEEL ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE 6TH CAR WAS SITTING ON THE WEB OF THE RAIL.  THE LENGTH OF THE DERAILMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 150`.  WHEN THE 4TH CAR ENTERED THE CURVE OF THE SIDING IT ROLLED THE NORTH RAIL OVER ALLOWING THE WHEELS ON THE NORTH SIDE TO ROLL IN THE WEB OF THE RAIL. THE WHEELS ON THE SOUTH SIDEOF THE CARS WENT ON THE GROUND NEXT TO THE RAIL.  THE WHEELS ON THE WEST TRUCK OF THE 4TH CAR WERENEW WITH GOOD FLANGES AND THE CAR HAD ROLLER TYPE BEARINGS.  THE CROSSTIE CONDITION IN THE SIDING WAS FAIR, THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE LATERAL FORCE OF THE CAR CAUSED THE RAIL TO ROLL WHICH, IN TURN, CAUSED THE DERAILMENT","Joint Track Type":"Siding","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"3S","Class":"3S","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"WTJRA05002200506","Report Key":"WTJRA05002200506","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"WTJR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"WICHITA, TILLMAN & JACKSON RAILWAY COMPANY, INC.","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Rio Grande Pacific","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"WTJR","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"WICHITA, TILLMAN & JACKSON RAILWAY COMPANY, INC.","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Rio Grande Pacific"}
