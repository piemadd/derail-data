IT BEGAN TOSNOW AS THE TRAIN LEFT SEWARD.  NEAR MP 47, THE RADAR ON THE LEAD LOCOMOTIVE BECAME FOULED WITH SNOW AND THE TRAIN WAS REQUIRED TO STOP TO CLEAN THE UNIT.  NEAR MP 49, THE TRAIN STALLED BECAUSE OF ANEMERGENCY APPLICATION OF THE AIR BRAKES, POSSIBLY AN AIR HOSE SEPARATION CAUSED BY THE DEEP SNOW.THE TRAIN WAS STOPPED A 3% DESCENDING GRADE AND WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE.  BECAUSE THIS LOCATION IS INAN AVALANCHE CHUTE, THE CREW WAS INSTRUCTED TO CUT THE LOCOMOTIVES AWAY FROM THE TRAIN AND CONTINUENORTHWARD.  A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE TRAIN, THE LOCOMOTIVES ENCOUNTERED A SNOW SLOUGH AND STALLEDAT THAT POINT.  BECAUSE OF THE AVALANCHE DANGER, THE CREW WAS EVACUATED WITH A BULLDOZER, AS THERE IS NO ROAD ACCESS TO THAT AREA.  AT SOME TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE TRAIN WAS ABANDONED (3/25/09 4:30 AM)AND WHEN THERE WAS A FLIGHT OBSERVATION OF THE SCENE (3/25/09 10:15 AM), AN AVALANCHE HAD OCCURRED AND CAUSED THE REAR LOCOMOTIVE AND SEVEN CARS (POSITIONS: 3, 7, 8. 9, 11, 12, 15, AND 16 ) TO DERAIL.NO INJURIES RESULTED FROM THIS INCIDENT OR DURING THE PROCESS OF GETTING THE MAIN TRACK OPENED.  THE ALASKA RAILROAD HAS YET TO RECEIVE A PERMIT FROM SERVICE TO RECOVER THE CARS AND LANDING INVOLVEDIN THIS DERAILMENT.  FOR THAT REASON, THE COST HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AND WILL BE REPORTED WHEN THE CARS AND LANDING HAVE BEEN RECOVERED FROM THE SCENE.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"ARR09046200903","Report Key":"ARR09046200903","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 2","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 -
