THE CREW HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO SETOUT UP INTERCHANGE CARS ON 14 TRACK BEFORE HEADING THROUGH THE YARD TO THE CEDAR RAPIDS IOWA CITY RAILROAD (CIC). \r\n\r\nIANR WACR-27 CUT OFF THE 10 REAR CARS FOR CIC ON TRACK 13 AND THEN PULLED FORWARDWITH 5 CAR LOADS OF OATS RIGHT BEHIND THEIR ENGINE CONSIST (FIVE LOCOMOTIVES ? FOUR OF WHICH WERE ON LINE) FOLLOWED BY 10 EMPTY FLAT CARS AND 20 MORE OAT LOADS ON THE REAR OF THE CUT. AFTER PULLING AHEAD TO CLEAR THE TRACK 13 SWITCH THE ENGINEER COMPLETED A STOP USING AN AUTOMATIC BRAKE PIPE REDUCTION. THE ENGINEER THEN RECEIVED RADIO INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE A REVERSE MOVE IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE INTERCHANGE SET OUT INTO TRACK 14. AT THIS POINT IN TIME, THE ENGINEER APPLIED EXCESSIVE POWER TO THEENGINE CONSIST WITHOUT ALLOWING ADEQUATE TIME FOR THE CUT OF CARâ€™S AIR BRAKES TO RELEASE. IN DOINGSO THIS CREATED EXCESSIVE LATERAL DRAWBAR FORCE WHICH SUBSEQENTLY CAUSED THE LEAD AXLE OF OTTX 93545TO DERAIL. THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED UNTIL A COUPLING WAS MADE ON TRACK 14. AFTER THE JOINT WAS MADE THE REVERSE MOVE INTO TRACK 14 WAS AGAIN INITATED. AS THE SHOVING MOVEMENT CONTINUED THE AFORE MENTIONED DERAILED CAR TRAVERSED OVER AND SPLIT THE TRACK 14 SWITCH. ONCE THIS SWITCH WAS SPLIT IT SUBSEQUENTLY DAMAGED THE TURNOUT AND TRACK TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT IS CAUSED SIX ADDITIONAL CARS TO DERAIL.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"UP0519GL038201905","Report Key":"IANRCRD0528193201905","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-7 - Commuter West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"IANR","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Iowa Northern Railway Company","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-6 - UP/KCS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"UP","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Union Pacific Railroad Company","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Union Pacific Railroad Company"}
