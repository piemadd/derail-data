WHILE CROSSING FROM THE INDUSTRIAL TRACK TO 200 TRACK AT THE CHAR CROSSOVERS 4 CARS DERAILED. INVESTIGATION HAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAD WHEEL (L1) ON LEAD TRUCK OF CAR #2 (ECUX 881529) CLIMBED THE FACING SWITCH POINT OF THE CROSSOVER AND FOLLOWED THE STRAIGHT PATH RATHER THAN THE CROSSOVER MOVEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE TRAIN. THE RESULTING FORCES CAUSED CARS #1 & #3TO DERAIL, CAR #4 MADE IT THROUGH THE SWITCH WITH NO INCIDENT, CAR #5 DERAILED THE LEAD TRUCK AND CAR #6 NEVER MADE IT TO THE SWITCH. THE CREW NOTICED THAT THEIR TRAIN HAD DERAILED AND PLACED IT INTOEMERGENCY. SPEED OF 12MPH WAS DUE TO THE GRADE BOWLING AT THE DERAILMENT POINT BUT WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE A PART OF THE REASON OF WHY THE CAR DERAILED.","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"POHCPOH822215D201510","Report Key":"POHCPOH822215D201510","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"POHC","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Pittsburgh & Ohio Central Railroad Company, The","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Genesee & Wyoming","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"POHC","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Pittsburgh & Ohio Central Railroad Company, The","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Genesee & Wyoming"}
