THE FOREMAN STOPPED THE MOVEMENT WHEN HE HEARD FLAT SPOTS GOING ALONG THE RAIL.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE UP39755, ALL 4 WHEELS ON THE A END SIDE HAD OVER 1/4 OF TREADBUILD-UP ALONG EACH WHEEL THAT CAUSED UNSAFE MOVMENT ALONG THE RAIL.  THE POD WAS AFTER THE BOWL 1/BOWL 2 FROG, THE CAR TRAVELED AN ESTIMATED 65 FEET BEFORE THE ENGINEER PLACED THE TRAIN INTO EMERGENCY.  INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE EXCESSIVE TREAD BUILD-UP CAUSED THE CAR TO JUMP OFF THE FROG,DERAIL, RE-RAIL, AND THEN DERAIL AGAIN BEFORE THE MOVEMENT WAS STOPPED.  IT WAS SUSPECTED BY MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT THAT A DEFECT ON THE A END OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM CAUSED THE WHEELS TO NOT RELEASE WHICH CREATED THE TREAD BUILD-UP ON THE WHEEL WHLE ENROUTE TO GRAND JUNCTION.
