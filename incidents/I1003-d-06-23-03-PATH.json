WHILE MAKING THE MOVE, THE CONSIST STRUCK THE DOOR ON THE WEST END OF TRACK 6 LEADING OUT OFTHE BUILDING.  SWITCHMAN 1 WAS OPERATING FROM CAR 812, AND SWITCHMAN 2 WAS FLAGGING FROM THE LOCOMOTIVE.  THE CARS IN CONSIST WERE 812-854-628-841-691-735-868-802-753-700-634-765W-F22-L1.  BOTH SWITCHMEN IN THEIR REPORTS STATE THE CAUSE TO BE LOSS OF COMMUNICATION.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT DETERMINED THE RADIO IN THE LOCOMOTIVE TO BE INOPERATIVE PRIOR TO MOVING THE EQUIPMENT.  BUZZERAND INTERCOM WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED AS AN ALTERNATE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONSISTS WAS A WORK FLAT.  BRAKE TEST WAS PERFORMED AND FOUND TO BE OPERATING PROPERLY.  THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS FAILURE TO PROPERLY FLAG BY THE SWITCHMAN. BOTH SWITCHMEN WERE SENT FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING AFTER THE INCIDENT.  ALL RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE.  TOTAL DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT AND DOOR IS ESTIMATED TO BE $25,100.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"2","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"PATHI1003200306","Report Key":"PATHI1003200306","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"PATH","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Port Authority Trans Hudson","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"PATH","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Port Authority Trans Hudson","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
