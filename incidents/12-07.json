At approx.3:00 p.m. that same day, P&L crew picked up the train which became train WW227. with three UP locomotives and 101 loaded coal cars, and derailed 9 loads of coal while leaving  track Zip 1 at Paducah.As a result of the derailment, 1578 feet of track was destroyed as well as extensive damage to Island Creek Bridge.  \r\n\r\nInvestigation revealed that the first point of derailment occurred 1578 feet in advance of the Island Creek Bridge.  Analysis of the event recorder data revealed that two emergency brake applications occurred.  The first occurred 1350 feet in advance of the bridge.  This indicates that the car derailed 228 feet prior to the first emergency application.  The second emergency application occurred at the bridge.  The UP crew was in possession of the train when the first emergency application occurred and when brakes released, pulled the train forward approximately 190 feet to the point of final stop.\r\n\r\nData from the derailment site, as well as event recorder and other information, was analyzed. Although a definitive cause for this derailment has not been established, based on analysis by P&L personnel as well as Rail Sciences, Inc. of Scottsdale, GA, there is no doubtthat the initial derailment occurred while the train was in the possession of the UP crew and thatwhen the P&L crew took possession and began leaving, the major damage occurred.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"2","Incident Key":"PAL2007DEC1D200712","Report Key":"PAL2007DEC1D200712","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 2","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 -

THE FIRST CAR, VAPX 91175, HAD R/L 1-2 OFF THE RAIL; THE SECOND CAR, VAPX 98104, HAD R/L 3-4 OFF THE RAIL.  THE FIRST DERAILED TRUCK STOPPED WITHIN 3 FEET OF THE ENTRY TO A BRIDGE.

BOTH DERAILED CARS HAD ABOUT 10 TO 15% OF THE COAL LOAD IN THE BASE AND ALONG THE ONE SIDE WALL.  THIS AMOUNT OF LOAD LIKELY CAUSED SOME HARMONIC ROCKING.
