CONDUCTOR GAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO GO WEST 17 CARS TO MAKE A CUT. THE ENGINEER GOT UP TO 10 MPH. AS THE CONDUCTOR WAS GIVING THE COUNTDOWN, THE ENGINEER PUT ON A 8-9 POUND REDUCTION. THE TRAIN WAS NOT SLOWING DOWN AT THE RATE THAT THE ENGINEER WAS EXPECTING. THE ENGINEER PUT ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS ON THE BRAKE PIPE. HOWEVER, THE ENGINEER DID NOT GIVE THE REDUCTIONS THE PROPER TIME TO EQUALIZE THROUGHOUT THE TRAIN. THE ENGINEER JUST KEPT MAKING A REDUCTION UNTILHE REACHED A FULL-SERVICE APPLICATION. THE DOWNLOAD OF THE LEAD LOCOMOTIVE SHOWED THAT THE HEAD OFTHE TRAIN MADE A 26 PSI REDUCTION, BUT THE EOT SHOWED THE REAR END ONLY MADE A 6 PSI REDUCTION. THERE WAS AN IMBALANCE IN THE BRAKE PIPE AIR PRESSURE THROUGHOUT THE TRAIN. THE ENGINEER, AT 2 MPH, STARTED TO APPLY THE INDEPENDENT BRAKE AND RELEASED THE AUTOMATIC BRAKE. SINCE THE REAR OF THE TRAINS BRAKES WERE NOT REALLY SET, AS THE ENGINEER USED ONLY THE INDEPENDENT BRAKES TO STOP THE TRAIN THE LAST 2 MPH, THE REAR OF THE RAN IN TO THE FRONT OF THE TRAIN, BUNCHING THE CARS TOGETHER. AS THE ENGINEER CAME TO A STOP, THE HEAD OF THE TRAIN WAS SHOVED AHEAD FROM 0 MPH TO 3 MPH WITHIN A MATTER OF A SECOND, DUE TO THE RUN IN. THE TRAIN THEN REDUCED ITS SPEED TO A STOP. AT THIS POINT, THE IN-LINE TRAIN FORCES CAUSED A SET OF TRUCKS ON AN AUTO RACK TO JUMP THE RAIL JUST PAST A CURVE IN THE TRACK, DERAILING THE TRAIN.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"TSWS92020174201707","Report Key":"TSWS92020174201707","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Switching and Terminal","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"TSWS","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Terminal Switching Services","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Switching and Terminal","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 - Short Line West","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"TSWS","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Terminal Switching Services","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
