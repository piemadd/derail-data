CONSIST INCLUDED 8 LOADS AND 0 EMPTIES DESTINED FOR PORT CLINTON.  TRAIN APPROACHED CLINT (MP 78.8) AT 20:38 AT 28 MPH.  CREW WAS COMPLACENT AND EXPECTED TO RECEIVE PERMISSION RIGHT THROUGH THE YARD, SINCE THIS WAS NOT WHAT NORMALLY OCCURRED.  WHEN THE CREW CALLED FOR PERMISSION INTO THE YARD THE DISPATCHER ADVISED THEM THAT THERE WAS A 31 CAR LOADED COAL TRAIN AHEAD OF THEM ON THE MAIN AND THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO HOLD JUST INSIDE THE YARD AT CLINT.THE JTPN-28 WAS OPERATING TOO FAST TO STOP.  THE ENGINEER PLACED THE TRAIN INTO EMERGENCY AND \"PLUGGED\" THE MOTORS.  THE JTPN-28 STRUCK THE REAR CAR OF THE COAL TRAIN AT APPROXIMATELY 12 - 15 MPH.  NOEQUIPMENT WAS DERAILED, HOWEVER THE LEAD UNIT OF THE JTPN-28 AND THE REAR CAR OF THE COAL TRAIN BOTH SUFFERED DAMAGE.  THE JTPN-28 CREW WAS RELIEVED FROM DUTY FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT.NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone","Joint Track Type":"Main","Joint Track Class":"3","Class Code":"3L","Class":"3L","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"RBMNR0329001200103","Report Key":"RBMNR0329001200103","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"RBMN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"READING BLUE MOUNTAIN & NORTHERN RAILROAD COMMISSION","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-2 - Short Line East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"RBMN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"READING BLUE MOUNTAIN & NORTHERN RAILROAD COMMISSION","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
