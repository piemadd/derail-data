HE HAD COUPLER TO 5 LOADED RAILCARS ON THE EAST END OF TRACK 1, WHICH HE INTENDED TO PULL AND SHOVE ONTO THE EAST END OF TRACK 2.  EMPLOYEE STATES HE COUPLED TO THE CARS AND STRETCHED THE SLACK TO ASSURE A GOOD COUPLE.  HE THEN MADE AIR TO THE RAILCARS.

THE ENGINEER STATES HE THOUGHT THE EMERGENCY APPLICATION WAS DUE TO ONE OF THE SAFETY FEATURES ON THE REMOTE SYSTEM  (TILT SWITCH, E-STOP BUTTON, DEADMAN FEATURE, LOW BATTERY) WHICH WILL OCCASIONALLY ACTUATE DUE TO VARIOUS REASON OR POSSIBLY DUE TO VERY LOW TEMPERATURES AND MOISTURE IN THE AIR SYSTEM.  IT WAS UN KNOWN TO THE ENGINEER AT THIS TIME THAT THE KNUCKLE ON THERAILCAR NEXT TO THE LOCOMOTIVE HAD OPENED UP AND SEPARATED FROM THE LOCOMOTIVE.  AFTER THE CARS WENTINTO EMERGENCY THEY ROLLED APPROXIMATELY 1 CAR LENGTH STOPPING ON THE TRACK 2 SWITCH.  THE LOCOMOTIVE STOPPED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WHICH LEFT APPROX. 1 CAR LENGTH BETWEEN THE ENGINE AND THE 5 LOADED RAILCARS.
