THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TOSHOVE THE CARS OVER THE SCALE TRACK, THOUGH NOT FOR WEIGHTING PURPOSES.  THE FIRST TWENTY-THREE CARSPASSED OVER THE SENECA #12/SCALE LEAD SWITCH WITHOUT INCIDENT.  HOWEVER, THE REMAINING EIGHT CARS COUPLED TO THE LOCOMOTIVES, DERAILED AT THE SWITCH WHICH IS LOCATED ON A SLIGHT CURVE IN THE TRACK.THE CREW WAS UNAWARE THAT THE EIGHTH CAR FROM THE LOCOMOTIVE DERAILED AS WELL AS THE CARS FOLLOWINGIT, UNTIL THEY MOVED  AROUND THE CURVE AND IT WAS REALIZED THAT THE FOURTH CAR FROM THE LOCOMOTIVE HAD DERAILED.  THE CREW CONSISTED OF AN ENGINEER, CONDUCTOR, AND ONE BRAKEMAN.  THE ENGINEER WAS OPERATING  THE LOCOMOTIVE UNIT, THE BRAKEMAN WAS ON THE LEAD END, AND THE CONDUCTOR WAS IN THE LEAD LOCOMOTIVE UNIT. WHEN HE REALIZED  THE FOURTH CAR HAD DERAILED, HE INFORMED THE ENGINEER TO STOP.  THE EIGHTH CAR THAT INITIALLY DERAILED , WAS LOADED WITH THREE SLABS TOWARD THE SOUTH END OF THE CAR, ONEOF WHICH WAS LONGER THAN THE OTHER TWO.  DUE TO THE UNEVEN LOADING, THIS CAUSED THE CAR TO RIDE UPAND OVER THE SWITCHPOINT, CAUSING TEN LENGTHS OF RAIL TO TURN AND THE CARS TO DERAIL.  THIS WAS WHYIT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT THAT THE DERAILMENT HAD OCCURRED.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE OPERATING ON THE SCALE LEAD TRACK, THIS DERAILMENT ALSO CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE SCALE (APPROXIMATELY $25,000) WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE TRACK DAMAGE AMOUNT.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"X","Class Code":"3S","Class":"3S","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"RTRT0133200106","Report Key":"RTRT0133200106","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"RT","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"RIVER TERMINAL RWY CO.","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"RT","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"RIVER TERMINAL RWY CO.","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
