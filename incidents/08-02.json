THE TRAIN HAD TO PASS OVER THE POCKET SWITCH IN ITS ROUTE.THE POCKET SWITCH WAS LINED GREEN FOR THEIR MOVEMENT AND THE ENGINEER CONTINUED OVER THE SWITCH APRROXIMATELY 10 CARS.  THE CONDUCTOR THEN TOLD THE ENGINEER TO KICK AND THE ENGINEER STATED THE KICK.THE CONDUCTOR DID NOT THINK THE ENGINEER HAD HEARD HIM AND TOLD THE ENGINEER TO KICK AGAIN.  THE ENGINEER THEN INFORMED THE CONDUCTOR THAT ID DIDN'T SEEM TO WANT TO DO ANYTHIND BETTER AND THEN WAS TOLD TO JUST KEEP COMING AS HE WAS SO THE CONDUCTOR COULD GET 3 MORE CAR LENGTHS.  THE ENGINEER THEN DOUBLE CHECKED ALL HIS GAUGES AND BUTTONS TO MAKE SURE NOTHING WAS WRONG AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP SAW THAT HIS TRAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 4 CAR LENGTHS ON THE WRONG TRACK.  AT THIS TIME THE CONDUCTOR WAS ALSOTELLING THE ENGINEER TO STOP, WHICH HE HAD ALREADY DONE.  INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT FOUND THAT ENGINEERING PERSONNEL HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE SWITCH THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  THEY WERE REPLACING THESWITCH STAND AND HAD SPIKED THE SWITCH FOR NORMAL MOVEMENT, THUS ALLOWING JOB Y101-16 TO WORK.  WHENTHE CREW ON Y101-16 WENT IN FOR A BREAK, THE ENGINEERING EMPLOYEES HAD FINISHED THEIR WORK AND PUTTHE SWITCH TARGET ON BACKWARDS AND UNSPIKED THE SWITCH.  THE SWITCH WAS NOW LINED AGAINST JOB Y101-16 THOUGH THE TARGET INDICATED OTHERWISE.
