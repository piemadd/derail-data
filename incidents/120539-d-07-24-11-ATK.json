THIS ALLOWED THE 3RD RAIL SHOE OF THE 706 TO COMEIN CONTACT WITH A DIVERGING TRACK WHILE THE LEFT SIDE 3RD RAIL WAS ENERGIZED, CAUSING A DIRECT SHORTTO GROUND.  THIS CONDITION WAS OBSERVED WITH A DM32 OPERATING OVER THIS AREA AFTER THE 706 INCIDENTAND EARLIER EMPIRE TRAINS THAT DAY HAD TRIPPED THE 3RD RAIL CIRCUIT IN SUNNYSIDE YARD.  AS THE ARCING OF THE R1 SHOE ASSEMBLY CONTINUED, THE FIBERGLASS INSULATING SHOE PADDLE THAT HOLDS THE IRON SHOEAGAINST THE RAIL WAS FLASHED AND LOST ITS INSULATING PROPERTIES.  NOW THE SHOE MECHANISM BECAME A CONDUCTOR AND CONTINUED TO ALLOW 3RD RAIL CURRENT TO FLOW TO THE LOCOMOTIVE CAR BODY.  THIS FAULT CAUSED THE R1 3RD RAIL AREA TO MELT THE 140 PSI AIR LINE, SUBSEQUENTLY BLOWING AIR INTO THE ARC AND FIRE, CAUSING BURNING DEBRIS TO BE THROWN AROUND THAT SIDE OF THE TRUCK AND INTO THE CAR BODY.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"No","Class":"No","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"ATK120539201107","Report Key":"ATK120539201107","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"ATK","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Amtrak (National Railroad Passenger Corporation)","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Amtrak","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"ATK","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Amtrak (National Railroad Passenger Corporation)","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Amtrak"}
