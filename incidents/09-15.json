THE CREW TIED ONTO THE CUT OF CARS IN ORDER TO PULL OUT THELOADED SCRAP CARS AND SETBACK THE EMPTY ROUND TOPS IN ADDITION TO ADDING ADDITIONAL ROUNDTOPS.  THECREW TRAVELED APPROXIMATELY 4 CAR LENGTHS WITH ½ OF THE FIRST CAR OUT OF THE BUILDING BEFORE THE CARS DERAILED.  THE CARS WERE LOADED WITH SCRAP COILS TO BE SHIPPED TO TUBE CITY FOR SCRAP PROCESSING.THE TRACK IN THIS WAREHOUSE HAS A CURVE TO THE SOUTH JUST OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. THE COILS IN THE SECOND CAR STARTED TO ROLL TO THE SOUTH FOLLOWED BY THE FURTHER COILS IN THE FIRST CAR JUST AS THE CARS WERE EXITING THE BUILDING WHICH CAUSED THE CAR TO LIFT OFF THE RAIL AND IN TURN CAUSED THE CAR NEXT TO THE ENGINE TO DERAIL.   THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE LOCOMOTIVES; HOWEVER THE 304 COULD NOT BE SEPARATED FROM THE CARS DUE TO THE ANGLE OF THE DERAILED CARS AND THE AMOUNT OF FORCE EXERTED ON THE KNUCKLE. THE CREW WAS ABLE TO SEPARATE THE 303 FROM THE 304 TO CONTINUE SERVICING TIN MILL HOUSES SOTHERE WOULD BE NO DELAY IN PRODUCTION.  A JOINT INCIDENT INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED WITH USS & GRWDEPARTMENTAL PERSONNEL. A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS DUE IMPROPER POSITIONING OF THE UNSECURED LOADED SCRAP COILS.","Joint Track Type":"Industry","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"Cl","Class":"Cl","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"GRW28201509","Report Key":"GRW28201509","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Shortline","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-8 -
