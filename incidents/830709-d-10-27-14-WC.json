THIS ALLOWED THE NORTH 39 CARS TO ROLL FREELY AND THEN IMPACT THE HEAD 57 CARS DERAILING UTLX950587, UTLX955326, UTLX955325, ACFX72461, MLSX21826, PLCX221418, TILX201349 AND GATX63990 AT THE SOUTH 56 SWITCH. AFTER THE INCIDENT, THEFUNCTION AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COUPLERS ON SMW735932 WERE TESTED SEVERAL TIMES. THE MECHANICAL GROUP DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NOT CONDEMNABLE PARTS ON THE EQUIPMENT. HOWEVER, THE COUPLER FUNCTION CLEARLY DID NOT WORK AS INTENDED SINCE IT WAS OBSERVED SEVERAL TIMES UNDER SEVERAL COUPLINGS THE LOCKBLOCK DID NOT DROP INTO POSITION. IF THE BLOCK DROPS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE IT CAN GIVE THE CREW A FALSE IMPRESSION DURING A STRETCH THAT THE JOINT IS GOOD.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"No","Class":"No","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"WC830709201410","Report Key":"WC830709201410","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 1","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 1","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-4 - CP/CN/CCD","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"CN","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Canadian National - North America","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Canadian National - North America"}
