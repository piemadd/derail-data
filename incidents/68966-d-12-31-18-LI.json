THE B END (3L, 3R, 4L,4R) OF THE WEST CAR 7419 DERAILED. WHILE NO DEFINITIVE CAUSE WAS POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED FOR THIS DERAILMENT, IT FALLS WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF “LOW SPEED WHEEL CLIMB”. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS, INCLUDING TRACK GEOMETRY, TRACK CONDITION, TRUCK CONDITION, WHEEL CONDITION, RAIL AND FLANGE COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION, TRAIN HANDLING, ETC. ALTHOUGH WITHIN FRA TRACK STANDARDS, THE CLASS OF TRACK FOR THE AREA IS MAINTAINED TO CLASS 1 CRITERIA. CONSEQUENTLY, WITH THE LOWER STANDARD OF TRACK, GREATER TOLERANCES TO ISSUES THAT MAYCONTRIBUTE TO SLOW SPEED DERAILMENTS ARE DEEMED ACCEPTABLE. NO ONE FACTOR IS IN GENERAL ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE WHEEL CLIMB. IN MANY INSTANCES, ALL THE PERTINENT MEASUREMENTS ARE WELL WITHIN APPLICABLE FRA SAFETY STANDARDS AND OFTEN WITHIN LIRR MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS AS WELL.","Joint Track Type":"Yard","Joint Track Class":"1","Class Code":"No","Class":"No","Joint CD":"1","Incident Key":"LI68966201812","Report Key":"LI68966201812","Reporting Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Reporting Railroad Class":"Class 3","Reporting Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Code":"LI","Reporting Parent Railroad Company Name":"Long Island Rail Road","Reporting Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned","Other Railroad Company Grouping":"","Other Railroad Class":"","Other Railroad SMT Grouping":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Code":"","Other Parent Railroad Company Name":"","Other Railroad Holding Company":"","Maintenance Railroad Company Grouping":"Passenger (Formerly Commuter)","Maintenance Railroad Class":"Class 3","Maintenance Railroad SMT Grouping":"SMT-1 - Amtrak, Commuter East","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Code":"LI","Maintenance Parent Railroad Company Name":"Long Island Rail Road","Maintenance Railroad Holding Company":"Not Assigned"}
